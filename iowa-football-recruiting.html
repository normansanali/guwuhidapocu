<span class=val><a href=./categories/blog>blog</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>Iowa recruiting update: Breaking down the Hawkeyes 2023 commitments</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>IOWA CITY, Iowa — <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Iowa</a> has filled the guts of its 2023 recruiting class, but defensive recruiting coordinator Jay Niemann has his eyes set on multiple classes every time he evaluates a prospect in person this fall.</p><p>“We’re trying to close out this ’23 class, and at the same time when I go out to watch these games on Friday nights, I’m looking at juniors and sophomores as well,” Niemann said. “So just to sit there and kind of compartmentalize it into one particular class, no, I think we’re well beyond that, and trying to see what’s in the next class behind, if not the next two classes, behind this ’23 class.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The Hawkeyes have 65 players on scholarship for 2023 before there is any transfer portal activity, walk-ons earning a full ride or seniors opting for a sixth season. They have 17 commitments in the 2023 class but have several holes at receiver plus at running back. They also are waiting on a few other recruits to make decisions.</p><p>Among the commitments, there are varying levels of relationships, Niemann said. Although he cannot name the players, the Hawkeyes have years’ worth of history with five-star tackle Kadyn Proctor. But there are several players who they met briefly on campus or during camp sessions with whom the staff wants to build better bonds.</p><p>“Without naming names, there’s some guys in that ’23 class I know that I’ve had communication with this will be going on three years,” Niemann said. “There’s other guys who maybe weren’t on your radar at that point in time that have gotten on to it be it their junior year, or maybe even early in their senior year, as you continue to evaluate and talk to high school coaches and things of that nature. So again, it’s an ongoing process. It never really stays the same.”</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of Iowa’s scholarship numbers in the 2023 class as well as the program’s committed prospects:</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/11/02173724/Kadyn-Proctor-scaled-e1667425145169.jpeg alt width=1785 height=1190 sizes="(max-width: 1785px) 100vw, 1785px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Tackle Kadyn Proctor committed to Iowa in June 2021. (Scott Dochterman / The Athletic)</span><h2>2023 positional evaluation</h2><p><strong>QB (4 scholarship players) —</strong> Alex Padilla, Sr.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Joe Labas</a>, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Carson May</a>, R-Fr.; Marco Lainez III, incoming Fr. <strong>Analysis:</strong> Iowa could shop in the portal for a starting quarterback. Padilla graduates in December and despite the offensive inconsistency has been unable to move past <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Spencer Petras</a>. May and Labas have shared scout-team reps this year. Despite two Power 5 quarterback commits in central Iowa, the Hawkeyes opted for Lainez and believe he can develop quickly.</p><p><strong>RB (4) —</strong> Gavin Williams, Jr.; Leshon Williams, Jr.; Kaleb Johnson, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jaziun Patterson</a>, R-Fr. <strong>Analysis:</strong> A fall decommitment from Florida running back Kendrick Raphael leaves the Hawkeyes searching at this position. A fallback candidate, Arnold Barnes, chose Nebraska over Iowa this week. The Hawkeyes will sign a running back at some point.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>WR (6) —</strong> Diante Vines, Jr.; Arland Bruce IV, Jr.; Keagan Johnson, Soph.; Brody Brecht, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jacob Bostick</a>, R-Fr.; Alex Mota, incoming Fr. <strong>Analysis:</strong> No unit needs a bigger influx of talent than at receiver. If this group remains together, Iowa should still target at least two more scholarship receivers, and at least one should come from the portal — at a minimum.</p><p><strong>OL (19) —</strong> <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Justin Britt</a>, Sr.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nick DeJong</a>, Sr.; Tyler Endres, Sr.; Mason Richman, Sr.; Tyler Elsbury, Jr.; Josh Volk, Jr.; Logan Jones, Jr.; Connor Colby, Jr.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Beau Stephens</a>, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Gennings Dunker</a>, Soph.; Mike Myslinski, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>David Davidkov</a>, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Griffin Liddle</a>, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jack Dotzler</a>, R-Fr.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kale Krogh</a>, R-Fr.; Kadyn Proctor, incoming Fr.; Leighton Jones, incoming Fr.; Trevor Lauck, incoming Fr.; Cannon Leonard, incoming Fr. <strong>Analysis:</strong> The group is taking its lumps right now, but there’s a decent foundation here. Proctor arrives in January and should have every opportunity to start at tackle as a true freshman. I wouldn’t count out a portal addition or two, either.</p><p><strong>DE (11) —</strong> Chris Reames, Sr.; Deontae Craig, Jr.; Lukas Van Ness, Jr.; Ethan Hurkett, Jr.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jeff Bowie</a>, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Max Llewellyn</a>, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Brian Allen</a>, R-Fr.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Caden Crawford</a>, R-Fr.; Chase Brackney, incoming Fr.; David Caulker, incoming Fr.; Kenneth Merrieweather, incoming Fr. <strong>Analysis:</strong> This group is deep and talented. Van Ness could become one of the nation’s top ends next year, while Craig, Hurkett and Llewellyn all are ascending players. Allen has impressed on the scout team as well.</p><p><strong>DT (6) —</strong> <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Logan Lee</a>, Sr.; Yahya Black, Jr.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jeremiah Pittman</a>, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Aaron Graves</a>., Soph.; Anterio Thompson, incoming Soph. (junior college); Maddux Borcherding-Johnson, incoming Fr. <strong>Analysis:</strong> Iowa cross-trains its linemen to play inside and outside so it’s not deficient in numbers. Black, Lee and Graves could form one of the nation’s best interior trios, while Pittman has the girth to play nose.</p><p><strong>LB (11) —</strong> <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jestin Jacobs</a>, Sr.; Kyler Fisher, Sr.; Jay Higgins, Sr.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jaden Harrell</a>, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Karson Sharar</a>, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Zach Twedt</a>, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Justice Sullivan</a>, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jayden Montgomery</a>, R-Fr.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Landyn Van Kekerix</a>, R-Fr.; Ben Kueter, incoming Fr.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Aidan Hall</a>, incoming Fr. <strong>Analysis:</strong> There will be no greater loss for Iowa than <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jack Campbell</a>, but getting back Jacobs after a season-ending biceps injury will be critical. Higgins will play alongside Jacobs. The Hawkeyes are waiting for prospect Asa Newsom to decide on a school.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>DB (15) —</strong> Sebastian Castro., Sr.; Reggie Bracy, Sr.; Quinn Schulte, Sr.; Jermari Harris, Jr.; Cooper DeJean, Jr.; A.J. Lawson, Jr.; Brenden Deasfernandes, Jr.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Xavier Nwankpa</a>, Soph.; T.J. Hall, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Deavin Hilson</a>, Soph.; <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Koen Entringer</a>, R-Fr.; Deshaun Lee, R-Fr.; John Nestor, incoming Fr.; Zach Lutmer, incoming Fr.; Kahlil Tate, incoming Fr. <strong>Analysis:</strong> Iowa has oodles of talent, but depth might be a concern at a few spots in the secondary. One possibility is for injured cornerback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Terry Roberts</a> to come back for a sixth season.</p><p><strong>ST (1) —</strong> <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tory Taylor</a>, Fr. <strong>Analysis:</strong> If true freshman kicker <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Drew Stevens</a> continues at his pace, the Hawkeyes should put him on scholarship. Taylor, who is 25 years old, could opt for the NFL after this season.</p><h2>2023 commits</h2><p><strong>Kadyn Proctor, T</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:</strong>&nbsp;Pleasant Hill, Iowa</p><p><strong>High school:</strong> Southeast Polk</p><p><strong>247Sports Composite Ranking:</strong>&nbsp;No. 11 overall, No. 2 OT, No. 1 Iowa (five-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> Proctor (6-foot-8, 335) was a priority for several years, and he’s the highest-ranked prospect in state history. He picked Iowa over <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Alabama</a> in June. The interest long was mutual between the Iowa staff and Proctor, who chose his No. 74 jersey based on former Iowa and current Tampa Bay tackle Tristan Wirfs. Proctor is close friends with Iowa true freshman safety Xavier Nwankpa (a Rivals and 247Sports five-star safety), and together they were a force for Southeast Polk’s state championship team in 2021. Proctor has immense size and matches it with athletic ability, toughness and work ethic. He plans to enroll in January and could become Iowa’s first true freshman offensive lineman to start a season opener.</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> June 30, 2021</p><p><strong>Trevor Lauck, OL</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:</strong>&nbsp;Indianapolis</p><p><strong>High school:</strong>&nbsp;Roncalli</p><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>&nbsp;No. 439 overall, No. 35 OT, No. 7 Indiana (four-star)</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> Lauck blends everything Iowa wants from its offensive linemen and not just optimum size (6-6, 290). He attacks defenders, drives through them and finishes in nasty fashion. He also can block in space. Lauck has positional flexibility but could develop into an anchor at either tackle position. He took multiple visits to Iowa City and his final decision came down to Iowa, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Michigan State</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Cincinnati</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ohio State</a>. Lauck has enough potential to challenge for the depth chart right away.</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> June 26, 2021</p><p><strong>Alex Mota, ATH</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:&nbsp;</strong>Marion, Iowa</p><p><strong>High school:</strong>&nbsp;Marion</p><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>&nbsp;No. 505 overall, No. 35 ATH, No. 4 in Iowa (three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> Mota (6-1, 175) is a versatile athlete and will play wide receiver. At Marion, Mota shifted from quarterback to running back this year and finished with 742 yards and eight scores rushing and 12 catches for 230 yards and three scores. He also had 37.5 tackles and two interceptions. In 2021, Mota ran for 629 yards, threw for 879 yards and finished with 28 tackles. Mota, who picked Iowa over Iowa State, is a do-it-all athlete, averaging 10 points, 5.6 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game in basketball. At the 2022 state track meet, Mota won the 100-meter dash and finished fifth in the 200.</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> Feb. 18, 2022</p><p><strong>Leighton Jones, IOL</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:</strong>&nbsp;Brownsburg, Ind.</p><p><strong>High school:</strong>&nbsp;Brownsburg</p><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>&nbsp;No. 526 overall, No. 42 IOL, No. 8 Ind. (three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> Jones (6-4, 250) plays offensive and defensive line at Brownsburg, and his quickness, short-distance striking ability and mean streak are perfect for Iowa’s blocking style. Jones finished third at the Indiana state wrestling tournament with a 47-4 overall record. Jones, who likely will play center, committed to Iowa only five days after receiving an offer and picked the Hawkeyes over <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Purdue</a> and several MAC programs.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> Feb. 26, 2022</p><p><strong>Ben Kueter, LB</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:&nbsp;</strong>Iowa City, Iowa</p><p><strong>High school:</strong>&nbsp;City High</p><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>&nbsp;No. 528 overall, No. 51 LB, No. 5 Iowa (three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> In his final two seasons on Iowa City’s east side, Kueter (6-3, 220) was a tackling machine with 188 tackles, including 64 for loss and 18.5 sacks. He also combined for 665 yards and eight scores this year as both a runner and receiver; last year he caught 24 passes for 369 yards and nine touchdowns. Kueter already has secured a reputation as one of the state’s greatest prep wrestlers (72-0 career record) with state titles at 160 pounds, 195 and 220 in his first three high school seasons. In August, Kueter won the U-20 world championship for Team USA at 97 kilograms and pinned his opponent in the gold medal match. Kueter also plans to wrestle at Iowa.</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> Sept. 19, 2021</p><p><strong>Marco Lainez III, QB</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:</strong>&nbsp;Princeton, N.J.</p><p><strong>High school:</strong>&nbsp;The Hun School</p><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>&nbsp;No. 564 overall, No. 28 QB, No. 11 in N.J. (three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> Lainez is coached by quarterback whisperer Tony Racioppi, who works with several <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NFL</a> quarterbacks in the offseason such as Kenny Pickett, Trace McSorley and Joe Flacco along with Petras. Iowa courted Lainez (6-3, 225) for about nine months before he committed in December. Although Lainez is considered a pro-style quarterback, he has dual-threat capability. In eight games this year, Lainez has thrown for 1,960 yards (22.5 yards per attempt), 19 touchdowns and three interceptions while completing 79.8 percent of his throws. He also has run for 477 yards and five scores. Last year, Lainez completed 80.2 percent and threw for 1,761 yards, 21 touchdowns and two interceptions. Lainez picked Iowa over Michigan State, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Pittsburgh</a> and Illinois.</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> Dec. 13, 2021</p><p><strong>Kahlil Tate, S</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:</strong>&nbsp;Chicago</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>High school:</strong> Kenwood Academy</p><p><strong>Ranking:&nbsp;</strong>No. 564 overall, No. 41 ATH, No. 10 in Ill. (three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> Tate (6-3, 185) picked Iowa over <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Wisconsin</a> and Purdue after visiting all three schools in June. A versatile athlete, Tate is projected to play safety but could shift to cornerback or receiver. At Kenwood Academy this year, Tate has 50 tackles and one interception. In 2021, Tate finished with 451 yards and 10 touchdowns as a receiver and had 63 tackles, five interceptions and two fumble recoveries on defense. His skill set translates to what Iowa likes from its defensive backs, especially at safety or its cash position. Tate has big-time hitting ability and good coverage skills.</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> July 12, 2022</p><p><strong>Chase Brackney, DL</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:&nbsp;</strong>Englewood, Colo.</p><p><strong>High school:</strong>&nbsp;Cherry Creek</p><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>&nbsp;No. 629 overall, No. 57 DE, No. 4 Colo. (three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> Physical, well-built and relentless, Brackney (6-4, 285) could wind up as the steal of the class. Brackney picked Iowa over <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nebraska</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Colorado</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>USC</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>California</a>. He attends Cherry Creek High School, the alma mater of Iowa backup quarterback <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Alex Padilla</a>. In nine games, Brackney has 48 tackles and five sacks. Last year for Colorado’s state championship team, Brackney recorded 85 tackles and four sacks, forced two fumbles and recovered two. He has positional flexibility, which is an asset in Iowa’s two-gap scheme.</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> Feb. 14, 2022</p><p><strong>Zach Ortwerth, TE</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:&nbsp;</strong>St. Louis</p><p><strong>High school:</strong>&nbsp;University High</p><p><strong>Ranking:&nbsp;</strong>No. 713 overall, No. 38 TE, No. 18 in Mo. (three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> A two-way player, Ortwerth (6-5, 220) has the size that could translate to tight end or defensive end. But his skill set suggests he can develop into a solid pass-catching threat. Through the Bills’ first seven games, Ortwerth scored five touchdowns and picked up 444 receiving yards. He also had 89 tackles and four sacks. Last year for University High, Ortwerth caught 20 passes for 299 yards and five touchdowns and also delivered eight pancake blocks. On defense, he registered a team-high 29 quarterback hurries and 16 tackles for loss. Among the other schools competing for Ortwerth are Purdue, Indiana, Illinois and Nebraska.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> July 4, 2022</p><p><strong>Kenneth Merrieweather, DE</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:</strong>&nbsp;Detroit</p><p><strong>High school:</strong>&nbsp;Martin Luther King</p><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>&nbsp;No. 788 overall, No. 72 DE, No. 15 in Mich. (three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> Merrieweather (6-3, 235) plays defensive end for <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Michigan</a>’s 5A state champion and shows remarkable burst off the edge coupled with short-range power. Through five games, Merrieweather compiled five sacks and 21 tackles. In the 2021 state title game, Merrieweather recorded a pick-6 in a 25-21 victory. Merrieweather, who had six sacks, had offers from Purdue, Illinois, Indiana and Cincinnati among several MAC schools.</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> July 7, 2022</p><p><strong>John Nestor, CB</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:&nbsp;</strong>Chicago, Ill.</p><p><strong>High school:&nbsp;</strong>Marist</p><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>&nbsp;No. 864 overall, No. 86 CB, No. 15 Ill. (three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> A hard-hitting defensive back, Nestor (6-1, 190) was all over the field at Marist. As the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>RedHawks</a> approach the postseason, Nestor has 50 tackles, four interceptions, eight passes defensed and a forced fumble. He finished his junior season with 63 tackles, three forced fumbles, four interceptions and 10 passes defensed. Nestor (6-1, 185) also returned kickoffs and punts. Although listed as a cornerback, Nestor also could play anywhere in the secondary at Iowa. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Iowa State</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Minnesota</a>, Purdue and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kansas</a> are among his 15 offers.</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> April 4, 2022</p><p><strong>Maddux Borcherding-Johnson, DT</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:&nbsp;</strong>Norwalk, Iowa</p><p><strong>High school:</strong>&nbsp;Norwalk</p><p><strong>Ranking:&nbsp;</strong>No. 940 overall, No. 107 DT, No. 10 Iowa (three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> Borcherding-Johnson (6-3, 277) was Iowa’s first commit in the 2023 class. He finished the current season with 32.5 tackles with seven for loss and two sacks. In 2021, Borcherding-Johnson had 36.5 tackles, including 11.5 for loss, last fall and earned second-team all-state honors. He has the bulk to play either a zero or one-technique as a heavy rotational defender.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> July 8, 2021</p><p><strong>David Caulker, DE</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:&nbsp;</strong>Des Moines, Iowa</p><p><strong>High school:</strong>&nbsp;North</p><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>&nbsp;No. 976 overall, No. 87 DE, No. 11 Iowa (three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> Caulker (6-4, 255) finished the 2022 season with 34 tackles, including 23 for loss and four sacks for the Polar Bears this year. In 2021, he recorded 4.5 sacks and 12.5 tackles for loss. He surged up recruiting lists during the late spring and picked up scholarship offers from Missouri, Iowa State, Minnesota and Nebraska. Caulker then attended an elite camp on June 5 at Iowa and committed one day after receiving an offer. Caulker also played basketball, averaging 9.9 points and 7.1 rebounds.</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> June 6, 2022</p><p><strong>Aidan Hall, ATH</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:</strong>&nbsp;Harlan, Iowa</p><p><strong>High school:&nbsp;</strong>Harlan</p><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>&nbsp;No. 88 ATH, No. 13 Iowa (three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> As a versatile threat for the defending Class 3A state champion and current Class 3A quarterfinalist, Hall (6-12, 200) has rushed for 463 yards and eight touchdowns, caught 38 passes for 690 yards and 12 touchdowns and 21 tackles this fall. He will play either linebacker or safety, depending on his body growth. Hall averaged 11.5 points and 8.0 rebounds in basketball last season. Hall picked Iowa over Minnesota in the spring.</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> May 21, 2022</p><p><strong>Zach Lutmer, DB</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:&nbsp;</strong>Rock Rapids, Iowa</p><p><strong>High school:</strong>&nbsp;Central Lyon</p><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>&nbsp;No. 104 ATH, No. 14 Iowa (three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> A likely safety for Iowa, Lutmer (6-1, 195) is a four-sport star with first-team all-state honors in both football and basketball this year. As a quarterback, safety and punter for the unbeaten Lions, Lutmer has thrown for 1,023 yards, 13 touchdowns and one interception while rushing for 971 yards and 17 touchdowns. He also has 36.5 tackles and two interceptions. For the Class 2A state boys basketball runner-up. Lutmer averaged 19.7 points a game.

(three-star)</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> In Leonard, (6-9. 265), Iowa is betting on its development. Leonard is raw but has good feet and is a willing and aggressive blocker. Plus, Leonard has a 6-10 wingspan and 10-3/4-inch hands. He did not have another Power 5 offer, but he was offered by several Mid-American Conference and FCS schools. If he hits his upside, look out.</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> June 21, 2022</p><p><strong>Anterio Thompson, DT</strong></p><p><strong>Hometown:</strong>&nbsp;Dubuque, Iowa</p><p><strong>High school:</strong>&nbsp;Iowa Western Community College/Dubuque (Iowa) Hempstead</p><p><strong>Ranking:</strong>&nbsp;No consensus</p><p><strong>Notable:</strong> Thompson (6-3, 290), a Rivals three-star, was starting to attract attention on the recruiting trail after picking up offers from Nebraska, Kansas, N.C. State, Washington State and Illinois. But just five days after the Hawkeyes offered him, the northeast Iowa native committed. In his first year at Iowa Western, Thompson has 21 tackles, including 5.5 for loss and four sacks. Thompson has blossomed from his Hempstead days, where he collected 36 tackles and seven for loss as a senior in 2020. He was an overlooked COVID-year casualty and went to Iowa Western, where he redshirted last year. Thompson will graduate in December, enroll at Iowa in January and be eligible for three seasons.</p><p><strong>Committed:</strong> Oct. 29, 2022</p><p>(Top photo of Kenneth Merrieweather: Scott Dochterman / The Athletic)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57knBscGlhbHxzfJFrZmppX2WAcLXOsJhmnp%2BkwaOty6Vkq52Tp8KqwMinnmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
