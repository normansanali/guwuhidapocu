Still, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Summer Walker</a> always knew she wanted to be a <a href=# rel>mother of multiple children</a> at a relatively young age. She and London on da Track share her <a href=# rel>oldest, known as Bubbles</a>. Of course, they've had a difficult time publicly navigating their co-parenting situation. When the Still Over It hitmaker announced her second pregnancy, this one with then-boyfriend Larry, fans were overjoyed that she had a shot at experiencing a healthy romance while <a href=# rel>carrying her babies</a>.</p><p>As her due date neared closer last year, internet sleuths noticed Walker's beau's sudden absence from her social media posts. They accordingly began speculating that trouble was afoot for the pair. She denied the gossip at first. Later, though, the mother of three later confirmed that she and Larry decided to go their separate ways. While the news was undeniably heartbreaking, she's managed to <a href=# rel>soldier on with grace</a> as she adjusts to life with two more children.</p><span><h2 id=h-summer-walker-mother-of-three>Summer Walker, Mother of Three</h2></span><p>Summer Walker performs during the 2022 Essence Festival of Culture at the Louisiana Superdome on July 02, 2022, in New Orleans, Louisiana. (Photo by Erika Goldring/Getty Images)</p><p>She's kept her newborn's faces <a href=# rel>mostly out of the spotlight</a>. Lately, though, Walker has been sharing occasional posts revealing their adorable matching outfits underneath emojis. Her first child, Bubbles, has often been seen on Instagram in the past. However, the Atlanta-born songstress seems to be embracing more privacy for the young girl as well. Still, she couldn't help but share a hilarious clip of her daughter "beating [her] ass" non-stop earlier this weekend.</p><p>In the video from her Instagram Story, the 26-year-old sits in her living room with friends and her little one, singing away as Bubbles begins attacking her. "This child stay beating my ass ðŸ˜‚. She wrong af," Walker wrote on top of the concerning footage. As the man behind the camera continues to record, the mother-daughter duo's scrap continues, though it's obviously the latter who's winning against her famous parent.
