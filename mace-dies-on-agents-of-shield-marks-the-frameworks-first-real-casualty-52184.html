In a final act of sacrifice that not only saved our team, but helps to sway Agent May away from Hydra, <a href=# class=T3D>Mace died on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> — both in the Framework, and consequently in the real world. The Patriot makes a sacrifice worthy of his name, and finally gets to be the hero that he desperately wanted to be.</p><p>First of all, I'm confused as to how he had powers again. Do we think that Jeff was taking serum shots in the framework too, or did Aida (sorry, Madame Hydra) not know that he wasn't really an Inhuman? Maybe the regret that Aida removed from his life was Mace's guilt over not having real powers. Seems risky, but if this really is an altruistic domino effect that went wrong, it's possible.</p><p>How about that conversion center, too? I thought The Leftovers had cornered the market on Lost allusions. Mace dies helping the team and a bunch of half-brainwashed Hydra captives escape. At least he gets to wear that awesome Framework suit, and manages to go to blows with May before the building collapsed. That was one epic fight.</p><p>Also, Tripp returns in this episode! I'm always happy to see B.J. Britt on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., even if it's just an alternate reality. Now, if can they figure out a way to bring him back to the real world with them, that would be swell. I'm not 100 percent yet on Ward, though. His apology was nice, but I'm wary. Hopefully we'll get to see more Fitz's Dad later too, especially as he is <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>played by my favorite Daniel Radcliffe impersonator</a> from Deathly Hallows.</p><p>All in all, the Framework has introduced a lot of fun elements to this series, and it's sad to see that it can taketh as well. I'll miss Jeff Mace on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. — while he may have caused some red tape problems for my favorite team, he had a good heart and represented the public face of S.H.I.E.L.D. well.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jqaYnJ1dmbamv4yopWaZl5q7tb%2BMqJ1mq5iesq2wjKaYq6OjYsGpsYyfqZqllay8s7fSZp2iqqOperOxwKVknJmjqq6twNhmbGtpaGk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
