The actress married her husband Rivington Starchild on 5 October 2022 in front of her family and friends. Her Hit The Floor co-star shared Logan Browning shared images on social media of Paige in her wedding attire (a&nbsp;white fishtail gown teamed with a braided hairstyle) on her big day.</p><p>According to DailyMail, after saying ‘I do,’ the couple entertained their family and friends, including Taylour’s Zola co-star Riley Keough, actress Andrea Ellsworth, artists Sophie Jeanne and Awol Erizku, as well as influencer Melissa Molinaro, at a fun outdoor reception.</p><p>Logan captioned the post “She is good” which also shows her holding a bouquet of white and yellow flowers. Meanwhile, her husband Rivington donned a dark tuxedo and bow tie teamed with a black hat. The bride also announced her wedding on her IG stories, “Head up chest out!!!!!!! ROLLIN IN PEACE!!!!!!! Yesterday was the greatest day of my life. God is real. God is the greatest… 32. Pushing the snakes pushing the fakes pushin ’em all off me like UGHHHHHHHHHHH. Back up off me DON’T YOU KNOWWWWWWW I’M A CHILD OF GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!”</p><p>Taylour went public with her relationship in mid-September 2022 when she displayed a large Tiffany & Co. diamond ring on her finger. She wrote, “Out of nowhere!! You appeared and showed me that the way that I love, was always the way because it’s your way too.”</p><p>As you may remember, Grey’s Anatomy actor Jesse Williams and Taylor Paige were lovers. They dated from May 2019 to the beginning of 2021. Williams was even considered Paige’s soulmate at one point. Paige declared that Williams was the other half of her soul in a poignant Instagram post from 2019 and expressed her gratitude that they had discovered love.</p><p>Taylour penned, “Finally after lifetimes and lifetimes and lifetimes and lifetimes x a zillion my soul found the other half of my soul that split off and out to learn and grow through contrast and clarity and perspective and appreciation. My familiar stranger. Now I can see!!!.”</p><p>As for Rivington, he dated his girlfriend <a href=#>Cuba Tornado Scott,</a> a model, <a href=#>GARAGE Magazine</a> Covergirl, and granddaughter of legendary director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Prometheus).</p><h3><strong>Rivington Starchild Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Rivington Starchild sits on a net worth above $500 thousand. Currently, Rivington is working as a fashion designer but before that, he was a musician and frontman to the band named New York rock band named DAMEHT.</p><p>DAMEHT was a three-man band, Rivington in the vocals, Roman Lewis (drums), and Lucas Garzoli (Guitar). Talking about the band’s name with Down Town 500 Magazine, they said, “DAMEHT itself came as a symbol to us, but it’s THE MAD backward.” The band also collaborated with photographer <a href=#>Clayton Patterson</a> (who famously documented the Tompkins Square Park Riot of 1988).</p><p>Speaking with Nylon the band talked about why they collaborated with Clayton. They said, “A lot of the figures we’ve followed have always wanted to preserve something, whether that’s preserving love in poetry, film or music, or preserving the human spirit. In our case, we’re wanting to preserve innocence—the feeling of naivety that allows you to get lost in what you’re doing, whether that’s making a cap or writing a song.”</p><p>They added, “That’s what Clayton did during the period he was making caps. He has done visually what we’re doing sonically, although we’re adding a whole pop perspective. We were looking for ways to communicate concepts beyond our sound and he really captivated us, like a virus. Why create something new if someone’s already done it so big? Why not attach and make it bigger?”</p><p>They also collaborated with pop producer RedOne (who’s responsible for Lady Gaga’s biggest chart scorchers).</p><p>Moreover, they collaborated with Shoemaker George Cox to release the iconic creeper. As for their music, DAMEHT released <a href=#>Girl Jeans EP</a> followed by a single <a href=#>Creeper Creeper</a> inspired by the iconic British bootmaker. You can find more of their music on <a href=#>YouTube</a>.</p><p>After moving to LA, he dropped music and delved into fashion. About his transition, he revealed to <a href=#>Union Los Angeles</a>, “I no longer had the ability to make everyone feel involved. I was the lead singer who lost his ability to lead. People don’t have ideas, ideas have people, and the idea of the rockstar had taken hold of me, I’m glad I peeped through the curtains and saw through the act. Right around the time, all this was happening, I found out about the possible Union x Jordan 1’s drop… crazy to say but that was what got me interested in starting a brand.”</p><p>Rivington is the owner of Rivington roi Rebis (RRR123). He said, “The Rebis is the outcome of the great work in Alchemy, the merging of opposites. For example, Cuba (1) + Rivington (2) = The Rebis (3), a third entity. RIVINGTON roi Rebis, Rivington the King of Opposites. 123 is the monad, split into duality and the outcome of that duality makes the trinity. It’s the way we make decisions, one situation, two ways we can judge or go about it, and the third is the action we end up taking. RRR123 RIVINGTON roi Rebis.”</p><h3><strong>Rivington Starchild Age</strong></h3><p>Rivington Starchild is 38 years old, as of Oct 2022.</p><h3><strong>What Is Rivington Starchild Real Name?</strong></h3><p>According to <a href=#>Shaded View Fashion</a>, the real name of Rivington Starchild is Rivington, his last name is not public yet.
