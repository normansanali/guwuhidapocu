The success of the project earned the boy an award from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA).</p><p>“He’s a born dog whisperer,” said Crystal Eskola of Augusta Animal Services. Roman and his mom transport pets in danger of being euthanized at high-kill shelters in Texas to their forever homes in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>“I think it’s very important for the dogs I meet that I give them the best chance at finding the right home that they need,” Roman said of his adorable Facebook videos, which feature the boy playing with the rescues. Promoting the pups online increases their chances of getting adopted sooner.</p><p>But the good news doesn’t stop there. In January, Roman <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">received $20,000 in donations</a> during an appearance on The Ellen Degeneres Show.</p><p>Mother and son used the generous gift to make two transports for Project Freedom Ride in the following month. One of the transports was a major undertaking, which cost $15,000 to transport more than 70 rescued dogs to their new adoptive homes in Washington.</p><p>It was a happy news story with an equally happy ending.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyprc%2BpsGamlazAbr%2FTqKminaNif3F9mA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
