He did not request the number — the only one he’s worn in his seven season in the majors — but instead saw it on the placard over his locker when he got to Marlins Park Friday, his first day with his new team.</p><p>“It’s pretty cool that number was available here,” he said of the famed Yankees digits on Friday. “Growing up, obviously I was a huge Yankees fan. Derek Jeter was the number I wanted to be — No. 2 — I liked Alex Rodriguez as well, a player I tried to emulate. No. 2 was always taken, but No. 13… has always been my number.”</p><p>A day after his trade toe the Yankees was made official, Gallo is embracing the chance to compete for a World Series.</p><p>And before joining his Yankees teammates, he even shaved his beard for the first time in 10 years to comply with franchise’s storied rules.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Joey Gallo sported a new look on Friday than he had earlier in the week.<span class=credit>AP Photo (2)</span></figure><p>“I literally had just gotten a haircut that day and I had the beard trimmed and everything. I think three hours later I was traded to New York,” <a href=#>Gallo said</a>. “I went home and had to do it on my own. I should probably have a professional do it at some point. That is probably one of the rules when you play in New York and I don’t mind doing it.”</p><p>Gallo owns a slash line of .223/.379/.490 this season with 57 runs, six doubles, a triple, 55 RBIs, an .869 OPS and a Major League-leading 74 walks. The 27-year-old has hit 25 home runs in 2021, the sixth-most in baseball.</p><p>“We’re incredibly excited to add two players that we feel like are really going to help us,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Thursday. “Hopefully people are talking about what a tremendous all-around player we’re getting [in Gallo]. A really good athlete: a guy that runs the bases, has some speed, that’s a really good defender in the outfield. The tremendous patience and power that he has … we’re excited to add an All-Star.”</p><p>Gallo – a two-time All-Star – is under team control through the 2022 season. And it is clear he is excited to be a Yankee.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk6GyorqMrJ%2BarpWjequ7xLJkoJmcobxus8StqmaZnJrFbr7Onamin6Wax7R5zqWbZrGRo7imsdJmpa6lkpq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
