Here's what we know about her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Nicolas Cage's wife, Riko Shibata?</h2><p>Riko and Nic were first spotted together in early 2020. They met in Shiga, Japan. The two went on dates in New Orleans and New York City before the pandemic, and when everyone went into lockdown, that didn't stop this creative pair from following their hearts. They were engaged by that August.</p><p>The couple married on Feb. 16, 2021, at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas. The couple chose this date to commemorate Nic's father's birthday. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People notes</a> the bride wore a handmade Japanese Bridal Kimono and the groom wore a Tom Ford tuxedo. The few who were in attendance included ex-wife Alice Kim and son Kal-El.</p><p>On Sept. 7, 2022, Nic and Riko welcomed a daughter named August Francesca Coppola Cage. August is Nic's first daughter. (He has two sons from previous relationships.)</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nicolas Cage has been married four times previously.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicolas met his first wife, actor Patricia Arquette, when she was only 19, by happenstance in a deli</a>. After insisting he would marry her someday, Nicolas asked for a list of objects he could obtain and bring to her, quest-style, to prove he was worthy of her affection.</p><p>The two briefly fell out after a disagreement at an airport but reconciled in 1995, where it was Patricia who proposed with a black wedding gown and a purple wedding cake. They were married from 1995-2002.</p><p>Then came Nic's marriage to <a href=#>Lisa Marie Presley</a>, whom he met in 2000 when he was still married to Patricia. Nic met her at a party, and contrary to rumors he was "Elvis-obsessed," during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an InStyle interview</a>, Nicolas insisted, "We got to talking, we got to know each other, and she's hilarious and she's a real firecracker, and she tells it like it is." The pair were married from 2002-2004.</p><p>Nic married actress Alice Kim in 2004. They have a son together, Kal-El (named after Superman's birth name). Nicolas and Alice separated after 12 years of marriage. Nicolas also has an older son, Weston, with actress Christina Fulton.</p><p>Next came makeup artist Erika Koike, who was first spotted with Nic in 2018. In 2019, they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got married for four days</a> before Nic filed for an annulment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7aku8uaqmabkZyybsPIn5w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
