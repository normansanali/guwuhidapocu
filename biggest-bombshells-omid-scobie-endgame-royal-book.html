"There's no time for that."</p><p id=erWB88cYTEIu data-wc=35>Mr Scobie told : "It would have been nice to see them come together on certain projects perhaps in the early years, to put on that united front, but they’re all working in silos."</p><h2>Different approaches between the Palace and Prince William</h2><p id=ebV5zNCi8Q data-wc=73>It's been reported that Prince William was "furious" when his godmother <a class=hm-link href=#>Lady Susan Hussey was embroiled in a race row</a> at Buckingham Palace. According to the book, William William "needed to distance himself" from the incident - and took a different approach to the Palace. A Palace source told the book: "It was a rash . . . knee-jerk response. The feeling was they wanted to disassociate, instead of thinking as a team."</p><p id=e2hzMnKKeR data-wc=41>At the time, a Kensington Palace spokesman said: "This is a matter for Buckingham Palace but as the Prince of Wales spokesperson I appreciate you're all here and understand you'll want to ask about it. So let me address it head-on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8b9a4993971c-prince-william-serious.jpg><p id=eMUPrmTYDa data-wc=69>"I was really disappointed to hear about the guests' experience at Buckingham Palace last night. Obviously, I wasn't there, but racism has no place in our society. The comments were unacceptable, and it is right that individual has stepped aside with immediate effect." Omid went on to describe the actions as a "swift rebuke and a remarkably different PR response to what we've come to expect from the Palace".</p><h2><strong>William ignored texts from Harry before the Queen's death</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a8532507c4b2-gettyimages-1425261876.jpg><p id=eDTi_Bb0T_vB data-wc=17>The book claims to recount Harry's experience on the day his late grandmother Queen Elizabeth II died.</p><p id=ezTQc5zA0bhU data-wc=23>It claims that William did not respond to Harry's texts as he tried to arrange a flight to Balmoral in Scotland from London.</p><p id=e7N3TK3voZLs data-wc=21>“It was upsetting to witness,” a source close to the Sussexes told&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Scobie. “(Harry) was completely by himself on this.”</p><p id=eBS5P0VcP_gG data-wc=28>The Queen died at 3.10pm on 8 September 2022.

However, according to Omid, Netflix deliberately released the first bombshell trailer for Prince Harry and Megan's intimate Netflix series, Harry & Meghan, on the same day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b20c8e02818f-shutterstockeditorial13646664at.jpg><p id=e9x-PsrJhQ data-wc=35>"Despite the promotional efforts and high expectations, the awards ceremony, by most accounts, didn't make the playoffs, let alone the Super Bowl," he wrote. "There was, however, halftime show entertainment courtesy of another royal couple.&nbsp;</p><p id=emCgz0rswm data-wc=42>"The first trailer for the Sussexes’ intimate Netflix docuseries, Harry & Meghan, released that same day (an intentional move by the streamer, I'm told), promising the "full truth" behind the couple's departure."
