Steve Drazkowski <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">made the bizarre comment</a> during a Tuesday floor session on Senate Bill 12, which would allocate $420 million over two years to provide universal school breakfasts and lunches.</p><p>“I have yet to meet a person in Minnesota that says they don’t have access to enough food to eat,” Drazkowski scoffed.</p><p>He went on to call the bill “basically fraud” and branded the measure “pure socialism” for trying to manage what children eat.</p><p>&nbsp;Drazkowski, who was elected to the Senate last year after serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives for over a decade, also mocked the definition of hunger.</p><p>“I had a cereal bar for breakfast, I guess I’m hungry now,” he told the room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/NYPICHPDPICT000008294531.jpg><p>“I didn’t see a definition of hunger in the bill.</p><p>“But I think most reasonable people suggest hunger means you don’t have enough to eat in order to provide for metabolism and growth.”</p><p>Earlier in the session, Sen. Heather Gustafson, the Democratic-Farm-Laborer party member who authored the bill, said that “roughly one in six children” in the state are food-insecure.</p><p>“That means they don’t know where or when their next meal will be available if they get one at all,” she said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Later that evening, Gustafson <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a> that one in five children in Drazkowski’s own district qualifies for free or reduced-price school meals.</p><p>Gustafson’s remarks were also underscored by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Star Tribune’s report</a> last year that at least 61,000 Minnesota children live in poverty.</p><p>In 2022, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hunger Solutions Minnesota estimated</a>, state residents made 5.5 million visits to food pantries.</p><p>Despite Drazkowski’s remarks, Senate Bill 12 passed 38-24.</p><p>Gov. Tim Walz is expected to sign it into law in the near future.</p><p>But even after the bill passed, social media users delighted in mocking Drazkowski’s tone-deafness — and his wardrobe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/NYPICHPDPICT000008294527.jpg><p>“I’ve NEVER met a person who has been to the Netherlands, and trust me…I asked around. Therefore, there is no Netherlands,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one Twitter user wrote</a> under a clip of the comments.</p><p>“He’s clearly never met a tailor either, yet those exist,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said another</a>, referring to Drazkowski’s apparently ill-fitting attire.</p><p>“[This is] what happened was that someone asked ChatGPT for an example of privilege and things got out of hand,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a third chimed in</a>.</p><p>Seemingly in response to the backlash, Drazkowski took to Twitter on Wednesday morning to say that snowflakes “don’t just fall from the sky in Minnesota.”</p><p>“You can also find them at the Capitol,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he wrote</a>.</p><p>Drazkowski’s office did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmam1foa64ucCknKtlo5bGtHnToZyrnV2Wv6Z5zahkoa2enL%2B6ecyipaedo6TBorrSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
