She apologizes for overreacting about Jude’s temperature, but it’s been awhile since she’s been a mother to a newborn. She brings up Holly, whose name Mark recognizes as the girl who asked his brother Aaron to Prom, but then rescinded the invitation. Wincing, Nicole explains it’s her fault since Holly’s grounded. Mark commiserates over being an authority figure to teenagers since he’s in charge of his siblings. After he tells her Aaron is still going to Prom, but with friends, Nicole gets an idea.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/tate-phone-pub-days-jj.png alt="Tate talks on the phone at a table in the Pub" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Outside the DiMera mansion, Holly and Tate make plans over the phone for him to slip out during Prom to meet her someplace special.</p><p>At the DiMera mansion, EJ assures Stefan that, as DA once again, he will reopen Li’s murder case. Stefan warns he better get Gabi’s conviction overturned, or Nicole will find out Eric is Jude’s true father. EJ explains it will take time. Stefan tells him to get to it then, or else he’ll tell Nicole. He smirks as Holly walks in. “Tell Nicole what?” Scratch that. Holly doesn’t care what they’re keeping from her mom since she’s a real nightmare sometimes.</p><p><i><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Traitors vet weighs in on Tom Sandoval</a></i></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1338-x-374-Days-of-Our-Lives.png alt="Text reads, Subscribe to Soaps' Days of Our Lives Newsletter.

As they reunite, she jolts awake on the Kiriakis couch to Brady staring down at her. Since she summoned him there, he asks what she wants.

Brady mutters this could have been a phone call and leaves. Theresa wistfully watches him, reminding herself she has too much to lose.</p><p><i><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital stands up for Tabyana Ali</a></i></p><p>After helping decorate for the Prom, Aaron meets Tate at the Pub. Tate wants to make sure Aaron is still on board to distract Sophia while he sneaks out to meet Holly.
