アリスは2014年に”学業専念”を理由に「ClariS」を脱退。進学した大学名は不明 アリスさんは2014年6月4日に「ClariS」から卒業。
卒業理由について「学業に専念するため」とコメントしてます。
私アリスは、学業に専念する為、今回の 3rd アルバム「PARTY TIME」をもってClariSを卒業する事になりました。デビューしてから3年半、ファンの皆さん、スタッフの皆さん、ご関係者の皆さんのお力添えのお陰で、幸せ一杯の夢の世界を経験させて頂く事が出来ました。私の人生の中での素敵な宝物です。本当に長い間、応援ありがとうございました。
卒業をした2014年は高校3年生だった為、大学受験の勉強と、その後の大学生としての生活を考慮しての卒業です。
アイドルの事務所トラブルや自殺などがニュースになるたびにアリスさんのことを思い出して心配になる人もいるみたいですが、アリスさんの脱退は円満で闇はないので勘違いしないようにしましょう！
進学した大学名に関しては不明です。
地元・北海道の大学に進学したという噂、上京して都内の大学に進学したという憶測など色々ありましたが、その情報も信憑生がありませんでした。
アリスのClariS復帰の可能性。カレンの声と激似？クララは素顔公開 ClariSは2014年にアリスさんが卒業した後、同年11月に”カレン”さんを新メンバーに迎えました。
その後のClariSはクララさんとカレンさんの2人でずっと活動。
念願の武道館公演を成功させたり、2人が素顔を公開したりと、ClariSは成長していきました。
アリスさんは”伝説のメンバー”として、現在でもたまに名前が上がったりします。
時にアリスさんの復帰説が出てファンが舞い上がったりもします。
カレンさんとアリスさんの歌声が激似な為に、”実はカレンはアリスで脱退は情報を撒いただけでは？”という都市伝説が出たこともありました。
今のクラリスにアリスが復帰したらPerfumeを超える？ 現在でもClariSファンの間で絶えず名前が出るアリスさん。</description></item><item><title>How Much Money Does Leslie Sansone Make?
