Netflix viewers rallied heavily against the release of “Cuties” on Netflix. The movie is simply termed as adultification and sexualization of children or just child pornography.</p><p>The matter went so far that U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has requested the Justice Department to look into Netflix and the makers of the film “Cuties” whether they violated any federal laws against child pornography. He also talked to U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr, for starting a criminal investigation.</p><p>Update: A Tyler County, Texas grand jury has been indicted Netflix on the criminal charge that alleges promoting “lewd visual material” of a child.</p><p>On August 20 2020,&nbsp;<a href=#>Netflix</a>&nbsp;found itself on a close edge after using an inappropriate poster to promote its coming of age French movie, Cuties. The poster showcased teen girls posing in skimpy outfits, and this attracted criticism. While a French poster promoting the same film shows the girls running while laughing and holding shopping bags, the US version presented the girls wearing tiny shorts and crop tops. Netflix was forced to pull down the poster and apologize for the inappropriate artwork.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We're deeply sorry for the inappropriate artwork that we used for Mignonnes/Cuties. It was not OK, nor was it representative of this French film which won an award at Sundance.

The free-spirited world led by carefree Angelica and her clique. Then there is the strict world of a Senegalese family comprised of Amy, her brother, and mother, Mariam. Cuties then explore the life of 11-year-old Amy living in France and waiting for her father to come back from Senegal. Amy and her family live in a poor neighborhood in Paris. Although her mother wants to bring her daughter up in traditional Senegalese values, Amy is rebellious and adventurous. Amy is soon fascinated by Angelica’s clique and their twerking dance, a version of an adult dance troupe.
