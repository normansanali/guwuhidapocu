Kunta’s life was fictionalized in the novel, Roots: The Sage of an American Family, by author <strong>Alex Haley</strong>. According to Roots, Kunta was searching for wood in 1767 when he was taken captive by slavers. He survived the Middle Passage to North America, where he was sold to a Virginia plantation owner, who renamed him Toby. Kunta rejected his name and attempted to escape four times. After being caught on&nbsp;his final&nbsp;escape attempt, he was given a choice: be castrated or have his right foot cut off. He chose amputation. Kunta married fellow slave, <strong>Bell Waller</strong>, and they had a daughter, <strong>Kizzy</strong>. Kunta’s story was shared with the world when Alex’s story, Roots, was turned into a television miniseries in 1976. Kunta was played by <strong>LeVar Burton.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Best Known For:<br>Kunta Kinte is best known as a character in Roots: The Saga of an American Family.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Personal Life:<br>Alex claims Kunta was based on one of his ancestors. Alex gained his knowledge of Kunta from his family’s oral tradition and a man named <strong>Kebba Kanga Fofana</strong>. Kebba claimed to be a West African storyteller, and said that Kunta’s family was blacksmiths. Researchers later challenged Kebba’s account on its accuracy. American author<strong> Harold Courlander</strong> sued Alex, claiming 81 passages of Roots&nbsp;was taken from his novel, The African. The two settled out of court, but&nbsp;Alex issued a public statement saying Harold’s book had been the source.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGianqSVl3yswc2tmGajmaPBpns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
