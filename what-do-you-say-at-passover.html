Use this holiday greeting.</h2><p>Whether you're attending a seder or simply want to wish your Jewish friends well, sometimes the use of the word "happy" isn't appropriate â€” not all holidays are! Thankfully, Passover is a holiday where a simple "Happy Passover" is an acceptable greeting.</p><p>For those who want to use a more traditional greeting, there are a few applicable Hebrew phrases. The first, "Chag Sameach," is the Hebrew equivalent of Happy Holidays, but if you want to be specific, "Chag Pesach Sameach" works too!</p><p>The word "Pesach" is pronounced PEH-sach, with the "ch" sound pronounced like Bach or loch.</p><p>Other greetings you might encounter during Passover include "zissen Pesach," or wishing someone a "sweet Passover," and "gut yom tov" which simply means "Good good day" in English. Also applicable is "Gut yontif" which means "Happy holiday" in Yiddish.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many days is Passover?

Traditionally, seders, or traditional dinners accompanied by food, the Exodus story, song, and prayer, are held on the first two days.</p><p>In Reform Jewish communities, the holiday is celebrated for seven days, while other branches (Orthodox and Conservative) celebrate for eight days.</p><p>In 2023, Passover begins at sundown on April 5 and lasts until sundown on April 13.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpmaxn6p6tK3YZpitZaCWwLS71Z6p</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
