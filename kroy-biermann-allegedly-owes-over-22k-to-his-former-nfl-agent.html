The Don’t Be Tardy star allegedly owes $22,120.70.</p><p><a href=#>A court appearance was initially scheduled</a> for early June <a href=#>via Zoom</a>, but Biermann and his attorney failed to show. Though Baker’s lawyer responded later that month by filing for arbitration, his representative also submitted a request for Biermann to simply pay his former agent the large sum he allegedly owes.</p><p>Biermann, 35, was drafted into the NFL in 2008 after playing football on the collegiate level at the University of Montana. From 2008 to 2015, he served as a defensive end for the Atlanta Falcons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kim-Zolciak-Husband-Kroy-Biermann-Allegedly-Owes-22K-to-His-Former-NFL-Agent-02.jpg><p>The Montana native then joined the Buffalo Bills in August 2016 as an outside linebacker. Weeks later, then-head coach, Rex Ryan, had to cut down the team from 75 to 53 players before the regular season began. Biermann was <a href=#>among the 22 men who were released from the final roster</a>.</p><p>Almost a year after <a href=#>Biermann’s Buffalo Bills elimination</a>, his wife, <a href=#><strong>Kim Zolciak</strong></a>, revealed how great it had been that he was able to stay in Georgia with their family. The couple, who wed in 2011, <a href=#>share Kroy Jr., 9, Kash, 8, Kaia, 6, and Kane, 6</a>. They also coparent Zolciak’s eldest daughters from previous relationships <a href=#><strong>Brielle</strong></a>, 23, and Ariana, 18. Biermann officially adopted the girls in 2013.</p><p>“I love it. I love him being home,” the 42-year-old told <a href=#>Bravo’s The Daily Dish</a> in April 2017. “He takes the kids to school in the morning and <a href=#>he’s a huge help</a> with all of my business that I’ve started, and Kashmere [Collection] and bathing suits and shoes. He’s been a super big help with that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former <a href=#>Real Housewives of Atlanta</a> star added, “I can’t imagine not having him here the last year. The kids listen to him better than they listen to me. The guy can do anything, seriously. He can sew, he can cook, he can make a wig … I don’t think it’ll be very difficult for him to find his other niche or what have you.”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqp%2BueqO1xKukmqaeYq6tuMSgnJ2kqWK8uLHSZqavnaJif3O3jK2mZqCZqHqnu9GmnKtlnpu5bq3GnqWtZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
