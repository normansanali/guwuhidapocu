However, there are ways to test the strength of your defense by having one of your clanmates mirror your base design and challenge you in the clan. This way, you can attack and check the strength of your defense.</p><h3>Can your village be destroyed in Clash of Clans?</h3><p>No, as long as you have a Shield or Village Guard active, other players cannot attack your village.

You can search for base designs as many times as you want and see the matching results.

This is done well before a new Leader is appointed.</p><h3>Why do villagers in COC clap?</h3><p>In Clash of Clans, villagers often clap next to buildings and obstacles to worship them.
