That character is done.”</p><p>Harry appeared as Sandra Clark in the NBC sitcom about the lives of women in a predominantly Black apartment building in 1950s Washington D.C. 227, which ran from 1985 to 1990, earned Harry a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1987. The series also starred <strong>Marla Gibbs</strong>,<strong> Hal Williams</strong>, <strong>Alaina Reed Hall</strong>,<strong> Regina King</strong>,<strong> Kia Goodwin</strong> and <strong>Helen Martin</strong>.</p><p>Although Harry may not be into the idea of a 227 reboot, she does still cherish her time on the show — especially her relationships with other cast members.</p><p>“Besides one Emmy for [227], one of my favorite things was meeting Regina King because she’s one of my greatest friends,” she shared with Us. “It’s something that I know to happen, to have a real relationship with a person you work with and having that whole experience of the ’80s: living well, many husbands and a great positive tone.”</p><p>Aside from King, 53, Harry also still talks to Gibbs, 92 — who still manages to go out to clubs despite her age.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jackee-Harry-Explains-Why-She-Would-Not-Do-a-227-Reboot-Cast.jpg><p>“She calls me at 3 o’clock in the morning … ‘Hey, what you doing?’ [She] says, ‘I’m going to be at the so-and-so [club]. You gonna be there?’” Harry explained, adding that Gibbs will go out around 11 p.m. “I’m serious.”</p><p>Since ending 227 in 1990, Harry has moved on to several other projects, including Days of Our Lives, which she has starred in since 2021.</p><p>The long-running soap opera, which has been airing on NBC since 1965, was nominated for 11 awards at the 51st Annual Emmys including Best Daytime Drama Series, <strong>Tamara Braun</strong> for Best Lead Actress Performance in a Daytime Drama Series, <strong>Eric Martsolf</strong> for Best Lead Actor Performance in a Daytime Drama Series and <strong>Dick Van Dyke</strong> for Best Guest Performance in a Daytime Drama Series.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Although Days of Our Lives was beat out in several categories, Van Dyke, 98, <a href=#>took home the Emmy award</a> for his role of Timothy Robicheaux — and became the oldest Daytime Emmy winner.</p><p>“Thank you. I don’t believe this. I feel like a spy from nighttime television,” he shared in his acceptance speech on Friday. “I’m the oldest nominee in history. I’ve been playing old men all my life. If I’d known I was going to live this long I’d have taken better care of myself.”</p><p>With reporting by Sarah Jones</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGam5uasm60wKupsmWimsOmrcusZLCgqWLAqbGMsKanrF2Xsm6wzqKloGWRYn9zg4yrnJunn6l8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
