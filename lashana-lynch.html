The actress only started taking up acting as her full-time job in 2010 and less than a decade letter she is filming a Bond movie (<a href=#>No Time To Die</a>), on the verge of becoming the first female Bond and also living a great life with her boyfriend.</p><p>Since a young age, the actress wanted to be in show business, and she joined ArtsEd school in London where she graduated with a BA in acting, but this was not the most difficult part of her struggle to become an actress. The real struggle was only about to begin, and she got her first taste of show business when she was hired to play the character of <strong>Belle Newman</strong> in the 2012 movie Fast Girls. From graduating in 2009 to getting her first notable part, there was a three-year period of auditions, rejections and learning phase which prepared for the next decade.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/09/las.jpg alt="Lashana Lynch at an event wearin a maroon dress without her boyfriend." width=450 height=225 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Lashana Lynch was hired to play the character of 007 in the upcoming James Bond movie.</strong><br><strong>Source: BET</strong></p><p>Following Fast Girls was the part of <strong>Shona Benson</strong> in the mini-series Silent Witness, and then steady parts in Powder Room, The 7.39, Atlantis, Death in Paradise and Crims helped keep her afloat. Soap was her next destination with the actress being hired to play the character of <strong>Leah Gattis</strong> in the daytime soap opera Doctors. Her other notable performance was in the Brotherhood, which led the actress to two steady TV jobs with Still Star-Crossed and Bulletproof. Both of the series were short-lived, but then this leads to the big job she was always looking for.</p><h2>Opportunity of a Lifetime, Getting Cast as Maria Rambeau in Captain Marvel</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/09/marvel.png alt="Brie Larson and Lashana Lynch at the Captain Marvel premiere." width=450 height=235 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Brie Larson and Lashana Lynch at the premiere of Captain Marvel.</strong><br><strong>Source: Distractify</strong></p><p>While working in Bulletproof, the actress went on to audition for a part in the <a href=#>Captain Marvel</a> movie. She was reading for the part of the best friend of <strong>Carol Danvers</strong>. The process was a hard one for the actress, she read the part, and she heard nothing back with the casting people probably looking to get the best possible person for the job and giving everyone a fair opportunity.</p><p>Then came the day when she received the call, and she told <a href=# rel=noopener>BET</a> about the amazing moment when she received the call. “I’m in a restaurant with my two friends, we’re chilling, having some food and then my manager calls me at like 9 p.m.,” she goes back to the moment and explains. “That’s not normal, but I don’t think anything of it. My friends straight away are like, 'That’s the call!' and they start filming me.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/09/captain.png alt="Maria Rambeau on the poster of Captain Marvel." width=450 height=669 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Maria Rambeau on the poster of Captain Marvel.</strong><br><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>“But I’m like, ‘I’m sure she’s just calling to see how I am.’ Even though it’s 9 p.m.,” she continues. “Then she said, ‘Yeah, congratulations!’ and I just dropped on the ground. My two friends are going crazy. They were like, 'Your life has literally just changed.'”</p><p>It was late in the night in London, and it was early in the morning in Jamaica, but the one person she really wanted to share this moment with was her mother, and her mother was in Jamaica in a low signal area, so this caused the signal to cut in and out of the conversation. But she understood the joy in her daughter’s voice and was happy, she prayed for so long for Lashana to get the part when it finally happened, it was a happy moment for both.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/09/mom.png alt="Lashana with her mom in the street." width=450 height=312 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Lashan and her mom on the street together.</strong><br><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>Lashana played the character of <strong>Maria Rambeau</strong> in the movie, and she is the mother of <strong>Azai Akbar</strong>’s character <strong>Monica Rambeau</strong> and also the best friend of Carol Danvers.
