Not only when it came to seeking justice for her state, but also her medical situation. Of course, EJ is not only wealthy but powerful, and he is financially able to help out. Still, Nicole and Holly are indebted to EJ for all he did to help Holly get out of the coma she was in.</p><p>Which could create a sticky situation where Holly is concerned. The young woman will come forward with a confession, and how Nicole deals with her daughter could be a source of conflict between EJ and his wife.</p><h3>Days Spoilers: Two Different Parenting Styles</h3><p>EJ isn’t Holly’s father, and even as her stepfather, he has no say in how Nicole should deal with Holly moving forward. Especially with the young girl being a teenager when they all became a “family”.</p><p><img alt="Days Of Our Lives: Nicole DiMera (Arianne Zucker) and EJ DiMera (Dan Feuerriegel)" width=730 height=413 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2024/03/days-of-our-lives-spoilers-will-hollys-confession-come-between-ej-nicole/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Days Of Our Lives Spoilers: Will Holly’s Confession Come Between EJ & Nicole?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DOOL-EJ-and-Nicole.png></p><p><a href=#>Still, if Nicole goes too easy on her</a> (or EJ feels as if Nicole is being a softy)) this could create conflict for EJ and Nicole. He raged hard against Tate when it came to his role as D.A.</p><p>EJ may reason with Nicole that he placed his neck and career on the line for Holly, and she should face some sort of repercussion for her lies; Nicole may take a gentler stance with her daughter, as Holly has been through a lot lately, and teens make mistakes.</p><p><a href=#>As the Baby Jude secret is coming close to being revealed</a>, could this conflict with EJ open a door for Nicole and Eric Brady (Greg Vaughan)?</p><p>While fans know that Nicole’s days are numbered on the show, as actress Arianne Zucker is leaving sometime in the late spring or early summer, this doesn’t mean that a brief Ericole reunion is not in the cards.</p><p>Will Holly come between EJ and Nicole?
