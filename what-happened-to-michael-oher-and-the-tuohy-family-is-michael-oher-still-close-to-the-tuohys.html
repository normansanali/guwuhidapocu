Fans believe it is due to the 2009 biopic “The Blind Side.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>While the rest of the football fans and moviegoers had a good time seeing it, the movie did not appeal to him, and he barely enjoyed it. Oher told ESPN that because the movie had a detrimental influence on his football career, he disliked it. He talked about how he was more outgoing in real life than he appeared in the film.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to one fan, Michael was upset with his parents for making the movie as it was not all true.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“You do know he even said that the movie was not all true and he was mad they made it. But also people do grow apart.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They were still speaking and on good terms during his sister’s wedding in 2016.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In the photos, Michael is beaming with happiness as he poses with his sister, Collins Tuohy, her husband, Cannon Smith, and the Tuohy family on the happy occasion.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On February 2, 2020, his mom Leigh Anne uploaded a picture of her engulfed in a hug with Michael with the caption, “He will always be my Super Bowl MVP! #ProudMom #Miami #PreSuperBowlPic #NFL #GoTeam #Smile”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The hashtags show they were still close at the time.</span></p><h2 id=michael-oher-wife-and-kids-where-are-they-now><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-michael-oher-still-have-a-relationship-with-the-tuohy-family></span> Does Michael Oher Still Have A Relationship With The Tuohy Family?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Michael Oher has cut off any relationship with the Tuohy family. The Tuohys have tried reaching out to him, but he seems to have cut them off.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Based on his recent pictures, Michael did not invite his family to his wedding. In none of the photos were the Tuohys seen.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Even his fans were antsy and concerned that his parents were not present on his big day. Considering none of his family members uploaded a photo on their social media congratulating him on such a happy occasion, he apparently did not invite them.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their loving relationship has soured to the point Michael has felt the need to unfollow his family on Instagram.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On the other hand, his mother still follows him, so he has not blocked them. Not yet, anyway.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His fans are not happy with his action claiming they are the reason he became a successful footballer.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“He would not have been anything had it not been for them so if they are estranged he needs to apologize and appreciate all they have done for him.”</span></p><h2 id=what-happened-to-michael-oher-still-play-football-or-not><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-michael-oher-still-close-with-the-tuohys></span> Is Michael Oher Still Close With The Tuohy’s?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Oher is not close with the Tuohy family and has stopped speaking with them.</p><p>He went as so far as not to invite them to his wedding. His family saw the pictures in the same as his followers did on his Instagram profile.</p><p>The last time his mother uploaded a picture of Michael on her social media was on Father’s day on June 22, 2020. At most, they have been estranged for two years.</p><p>His fans have called him gross for cutting off the Tuohy’s family now that he has become a successful man.</p><p>“Everything I’ve seen from him publicly that’s come out has seemed to shade them a bit. Since he’s got his own success now, seems he doesn’t need them anymore. Pretty gross.”</p><p>When he was 16, Michael, who had spent most of his youth in foster care, settled in with the Tuohys. Michael learned his ambition of playing in the NFL with the help and encouragement of his adoptive parents, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, and their family.</p><p>The entire Tuohy family cheered Michael and the Baltimore Ravens on as they won their first Super Bowl in February 2013 while they were all seated on the sidelines.</p><p>The Making it Happen Foundation, which “promotes awareness, offers hope, and enhances middles of life for disadvantaged children,” is where Michael remained active after his NFL career in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>Oher has an adoptive sister named Collins Tuohy. Michael Oher does not play football anymore. He announced his retirement in 2017.</p><p>According to Raven’s news site Russell Street Report, Oher bought a house in Nashville in 2017 and is worth $20 million.</p><p>Michael Oher’s path to the majors was more challenging than most. He overcame a lot of obstacles to achieve what he accomplished. However, by the time his playing career was over, the athlete discovered that he still had mental health problems, especially because of unsolved issues from his background.</p><p>His biological father, Michael Jerome Williams, was regularly imprisoned, while his mother struggled with alcoholism and cocaine addiction. During his childhood, he got less attention and supervision.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMpqCcoJGauW67x56pZpmemXq1tMRmq66nmK56p63MoqOyZZmoeq61wqGYnqRdpLWmvoysq6KknGKwrbvSnmStp12ptaZ5066mobGjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
