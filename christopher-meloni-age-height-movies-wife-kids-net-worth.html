To make him look charming blue eyes, along with brown hair, play an essential role.</p><h2>Early Days and Education</h2><p>Meloni was born in Washington, D.C, but spent his childhood in Virginia. His early life was pretty decent, with most of the needs being fulfilled with ease.</p><p>Christopher grew up in a middle-class family where his father was an endocrinologist and his mother being the homemaker. However, from an early age, Meloni was fond of acting and knew it was the way of life for him.</p><p>For the education attainment, though, Christopher was part of St Stephen School at Virginia. Furthermore, he was part of the University of Colorado, where he graduated in history.</p><p>To accomplish his dream of being an actor, he went on to take various acting classes that helped his rapid growth.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>After 1983, Christopher moved to New York and started his acting career with some background work. He was part of Neighbourhood Playhouse and the Centre of Media Arts.</p><p>The initial days were not much more comfortable as he had to do odd jobs like construction labor, bartender, bouncer, and many more.

It seems like the actor is busier in the TV work for sure.</p><h2>Awards and Accolades</h2><p>Christopher has been part of the acting industry for over two decades, and his contributions to this field have been outstanding. Moreover, for the case of winning awards and accolades, he is blessed.</p><p>In 1999 the actor won the OFTA Tv awards for the work in OZ as the best guest actor.

After dating for some period of time, the pair walked down the aisle on 1st July 1995.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/meloni-405.jpg><p>It was an auspicious occasion with the family and friends being invited to it. Not only getting married, but the love birds are blessed with kids <strong>Sophia Meloni</strong> and <strong>Dante Meloni.</strong></p><p>It has been more than two decades since their marriage, and hardly there is any rift seen between the two.
