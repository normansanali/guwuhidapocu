The title wasn't on the line, but a win for The Bunny would have likely catapulted her up the AEW women's rankings and earned her a shot at the gold sometime in the near future. Unfortunately, The Bunny's match with Hayter was brought to an end prematurely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=potential-concussion-and-broken-orbital-bone>Potential Concussion And Broken Orbital Bone</h2><p>You may well have noticed the match ended pretty abruptly, and that appears to be because The Bunny may well have suffered a pretty serious injury. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PWInsider</a>, The Bunny might have potentially suffered a concussion, and could even be sporting a broken orbital bone following a collision with Hayter in the match.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>AEW Dynamite Winners & Losers: MJF & Bryan Danielson Set, Epic Trios Match, The Gunns Shock The Acclaimed</a></span></p><p>Neither The Bunny nor AEW has confirmed either of those injuries at the time of typing this, but if she was concussed or suffered a facial fracture, hopefully she won't be on the shelf too long and makes a quick recovery. Concussions are serious business, something <a href=#>Adam Cole's recent comments have reminded fans of</a> after he told them about the troubling time off he had recovering from his most recent one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-it-happened>How It Happened</h2><p>As for how exactly it happened, again while not confirmed, the belief is that the incident occurred during the spot above. Bunny and Hayter appear to get mixed up regarding which spot they're going to do next. The champ attempts to hit her opponent with a suplex but Bunny doesn't go over. That leads to the two of them awkwardly falling over with Hayter landing on The Bunny's head.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The above video also shows The Bunny being helped out of the arena after the match, clearly not in a very good way. Hopefully she makes a quick recovery, regardless of the injuries she might have suffered. As for Hayter's next challenger, despite still being TBS Champion, after 50 wins and zero losses, <a href=#>Jade Cargill has made it clear she wants to challenge for the main Women's Title</a>.</p><p><strong>TheSportster Podcast has returned!
