But his comments are culturally uneducated and a blind attack with zero substance related to this project.</p><p>The reality of the ignorance piece falls within his statement suggesting his personal view on being ‘Latino,’ because a land mass or living area does not determine a person’s blood history or genetics.”</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>Moreover, O’Felan emphasized in a statement to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter </a>that the film isn’t about Fidel. It’s about his daughter, Alina Fernández, whose unique story is being decentered over Leguizamo’s criticism of a secondary casting decision that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alina ostensibly supports</a>:</p><p>“I think he should move past himself and also acknowledge that this story is about a Latin female immigrant living in America who is of historical importance, led by a Latin woman and I’m just an underdog who is making it, so he should also understand that it’s kind of disappointing to see our work getting attacked by someone who claims to be a leader of the Latin community.”</p><p data-characters=575 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>O’Felan isn’t the only person feeling defensive about Franco playing Castro. Fans have noted that Franco and Castro descend from neighboring countries in Europe (Portugal and Spain, respectively). Further, they’ve thwarted accusations of “whitewashing” by stating that “Latino” is not a race, given that, among others, there are black Latinos, indigenous Latinos, and white Latinos. Castro would have likely fallen into the last of those categories; Malcolm X called him <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“the only white person that I have really liked.”</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>People getting offended over this are the same people that said there is nothing wrong with a Cuban actress playing Marilyn Monroe, it's not like they're Changing the race of the person.
