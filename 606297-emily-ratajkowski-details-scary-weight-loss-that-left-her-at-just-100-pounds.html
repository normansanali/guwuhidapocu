Whether it be on her ever-growing TikTok page, or her new High Low podcast, the mother of one is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">living relatively unfiltered</a> these days.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Most of the headlines surrounding her lately have been about her <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">rumoured beau, Pete Davidson</a>. Today, however, the latest episode of her show has people talking for another reason – her body.</p><p>Emily Ratajkowski attends the 2021 CFDA Fashion Awards at The Grill Room on November 10, 2021 in New York City.

She's susceptible to constant scrutiny, and with that certainly comes no shortage of stress.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On Tuesday (November 29), the Gone Girl actress debuted a new High Low interview. This time around, she interviewed former adult actress Mia Khalifa – another unfiltered social media starlet. At one point during their chat, the two got to talking about the correlation between mental and physical health.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I think trauma lives in the body," Em Rata told her friend. "That’s been my experience. When I’m really unwell, I lose so much weight."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Apparently, at the height of her struggles, the 31-year-old weighed just 100 pounds. "It was really, really scary," she recalled.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Since then, though, Ratajkowski has been able to turn things around, noting that she's put on weight. She explained, "For me, it’s a huge game-changer and how I know I’m happy."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It's been an undeniably tough few months for the London-born beauty. As you may recall, in July we found out that she's separating from her husband of four years, Sebastian Bear-McClard.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Breakups are tough initially, of course, but it seems that Ratajkowski is back on the market lately. Though she's made headlines with Brad Pitt and Orazio Rispo, it seems to be Pete Davidson whose company she really enjoys.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Recently, the rumoured lovers sat courtside at a Knicks game, causing a serious stir online.
