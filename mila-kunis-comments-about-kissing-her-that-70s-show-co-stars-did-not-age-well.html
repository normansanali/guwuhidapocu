Mila Kunis was fresh into her career and on the verge of becoming a star. Instead of celebrating that fact, she was asked about kissing several of her That '70s Show co-stars. At that point, Topher Grace was the only cast member she didn't kiss. Given what came to light with Danny Masterson, her response was that much more alarming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She said, "I kissed the Mastersons, I've kissed everybody.

Kunis continues about the wrtiers on the show, "I don't know what they're thinking, I just have no choice but to kiss every guy on the show."</p><p>Not the greatest video quality... but definitely worth the look below.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/your-paragraph-text-2023-09-20t132249-909.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Mila Kunis' Response To A Topher Grace Question Did Not Age Well With Fans">Mila Kunis' Response To A Topher Grace Question Did Not Age Well With Fans</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Mila Kunis' words about Topher Grace in a prior interview caused a reaction among That '70s Show fans.</p><p>Fans had a lot to say looking back at the interview.</p><p>“I had no choice but to kiss every guy on the show”.

One of them featured <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Masterson betting Ashton $10 to French kiss an underage Mila Kunis</a>.</p><p>Kutcher revealed years ago in 2002, “She was 14 when we started the show. I was 19. And they were like, ‘You guys are going to be making out in this scene.’ And I’m thinking, ‘Wait, this is slightly illegal.'”</p><p>Kunis adds, “I was a 14-year-old little girl and I was extremely scared for my life. He was very nice about it, like, ‘Don’t worry about it.’ Then Danny goes to him and goes, ‘Dude, I’ll give you $10 if you French kiss her.'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/your-paragraph-text-2024-01-30t085934-345.png><p>The bet was also confirmed by Kutcher himself.</p><p>“We had a little side bet going,” Kutcher confirms. “You’re kissing on the show, we’re boyfriend and girlfriend.

So, to go back and have it be this new shared experience was really wild and nostalgic. There’s so many memories that come alive, like when you see the basement again or these characters that were so much a part of our life for such a long time. It was just so nostalgic for us. I’m excited for these kids that are hopefully going to experience the same ride we got to go on when we were their age."</p><p>He continued, "Any day I get to go to work with my wife is the best day of the year. I think the crazy thing about that experience is we are in a completely different place in our relationship now than where we were then."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Without a doubt, fans would be open to seeing the two reunite once again on That '90s Show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikoqSRYri2usisZJynnaKyr8DSZpibp6Wpeqy10qygp59dnbKzedOhmK1lZ2XAbr%2FHqK5mm59iwLWt0axknaGUYruwwIyanp5lp5q5rXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
