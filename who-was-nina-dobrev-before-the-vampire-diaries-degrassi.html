The 33-year-old shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon, and if anything, she should have had a solid acting career after departing The Vampire Diaries. Since then, she has been around Hollywood, picking some romantic roles in the meantime, but her career is still far from its peak. She's been diving more into film roles and withdrawing herself from TV projects, but sadly, almost none of them was a blockbuster hit except for 2017's Return of Xander Cage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nina's career is still far from obscurity, though.
