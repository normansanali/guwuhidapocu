Rated R (profanity). At the Union Square and the City Cinemas.</p><p>‘Why do you suppose I just hurled a chair at your head?” an imperious bandleader asks his cowering new drummer, Andrew, as the boy checks to make sure his head is still attached to his body.</p><p>The answer: Because Andrew might have what it takes to go all the way. But only if he is pushed.</p><p>“Whiplash,” a thrilling and propulsive drama about excellence and its enemies, reimagines a music conservatory (a fictitious one in Manhattan) as a boot camp, with an <a href=#>incendiary J.K. Simmons ruling the screen as Terence Fletcher</a>, the domineering, maddening, abusive, pitiless, borderline criminal band conductor who urges <a href=#>young jazz drummer Andrew</a> (<a href=#>Miles Teller</a>, also first-rate) to surpass his limits.</p><p>Charlie Parker didn’t become “Bird,” we learn, until drummer Jo Jones threw a cymbal at him. Hence the airborne chair, and the exhilarating weight it carries: Fletcher actually thinks Andrew could be the Charlie Parker of the drum kit.</p><p>Someday someone will collect Fletcher’s commentary on Andrew’s playing in a single, exceedingly rude clip: “Do I look like a double f–king rainbow to you?” “You are a worthless, friendless, f—-t-lipped piece of s–t.” “Pathetic pansy-ass fruit-f–k.”</p><p>I could go on. Fletcher is cruel, he’s brutal, he’s rageful, he’s…inappropriate. And he’s the kind of man for whom boys would walk through fire, always have.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/10/whiplash-1.jpg><p>The brief, dismissive appearance of a girl in the cast — Melissa Benoist is perfect as the cutie with whom Andrew has a few dates before he decides romance would interfere with his quest — underlines the bold masculinity of “Whiplash.”</p><p>Rarely do manly virtues and methods receive such invigorating understanding on-screen.</p><p>Even the other man in the cast, Andrew’s limp washcloth of a father (Paul Reiser) is a walking illustration of why this motherless boy is so in need of paternal discipline.</p><p>“There are no two words in the English language more harmful than ‘good job,’” Fletcher says, delivering the final two syllables with expert loathing.</p><p>But this bull in a black T-shirt is a figure from another era, and the excellence he represents is opposed by an even more powerful force: the quicksand suck of political correctness.</p><p>Dramatizing all this evocatively, and making it heave with energy, is 29-year-old writer-director Damien Chazelle, in just his second film.</p><p>“Whiplash” (named for an especially difficult tune) is intense and driven, as exciting as a youthful glimpse of genius in the distance.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfnV7kGlmaXBfmb%2B2ucyipaBllKeurq2MsJ%2BiqJyWwKl5yKxkqKaVYrynedOhnGaxlZa%2FtHnBnqqtZZaeua6%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
