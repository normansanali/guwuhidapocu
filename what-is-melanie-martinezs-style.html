Her debut album Cry Baby and second album K-12 were seen to have hip-hop and R&B undertones.</p><p>The subject matter of Martinez’s songs is typically based on personal experiences. Martinez describes her own music as “very dark and honest” and “hip hop/trap-inspired beats with creepy nostalgic childlike sounds such as baby pianos, music boxes, and toys”.</p><p>Martinez’s music has been described by The Guardian as “off-kilter, sweary electropop”. Rolling Stone described Martinez’s music as “twisted lullabies about love, danger and madness”, and compared her music to that of “‘Coin-Operated Boy’era Dresden Dolls” and Lana Del Rey.</p><p>The New York Times‘s Jon Pareles described her music as “perch[ing] prettily tinkling keyboards and concise pop choruses amid the slow, ominous basslines and twitchy percussion of Southern hip-hop – a candy-coated variation on the dirges of Lorde and Lana Del Rey”, and described her mezzo-soprano voice&nbsp;as “whispery, sardonic, tearful, [and] furious”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutdJmpJ6kkaO2pnnMmqmtoZ6ax7R50q2wpZ1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
