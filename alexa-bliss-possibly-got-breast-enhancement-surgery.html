But as it turns out there’s a pretty interesting rumor floating around that Bliss could have picked up a couple new additions in the meantime.</p><p>Bryan Alvarez mentioned Alexa Bliss on Wrestling Observer Live where he brought up something that&nbsp;a lot of fans were thinking. Judging by some recent photographs a lot of people have considered the possibility that Bliss had some kind of recent breast augmentation surgery.</p><p>”I cant confirm anything but she’s been enhanced I believe, very recently.”</p><p>Usually, someone needs to wait around six weeks before they can get back to serious exercise&nbsp;after some kind of breast enhancement surgery but there are varying degrees of augmentation at this point. So the jury is still out as far as when she’ll wrestle again. But Bliss has been a regular on the road and it would stand to reason that WWE isn’t going to let her sit on the sidelines for six weeks but they’ve done stranger things before.</p><p>While it might only be rumor at this point, Bliss’ recent addition to her Instagram story gave some fans even more proof that Little Miss Bliss might have had some kind of work done.</p><p></p><p>If you use our quotes credit Ringside News</p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS. These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX55e49tZmpxX5a5psTAZpmloaOoerG70qygm6SpYrSwwIybqZ6Zo6l6prrHmqWcnZ2au7V50q6poJ2irnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
