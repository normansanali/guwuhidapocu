"I think it's good Kim Kardashian doesn't like Indian food, because that means she won't ever visit India and that in itself is a blessing," one user wrote.</p><p>Said another, "Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner called Indian food 'so disgusting.' Seriously? You don't have to like it, [but] don't be rude."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On Tuesday, Kardashian took to her <a href=#>blog</a> to address the backlash in a post titled "Just Want to Clear Something Up."</p><p>"In NO way was [my comment] intended as an insult to the Indian people or their culture. This is just my own personal taste," she wrote. "There are a lot of foods I don't like . . . I hate cilantro and peppers, and there are definitely some Armenian foods that I personally find disgusting, but that doesn't reflect my opinions on other Armenian people or my culture."</p><p>Explained the E! star, "My comment wasn't intended to offend anybody. We all have our own opinions and tastes and I was simply expressing mine."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1iuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo3qqeceaq55lmaOxqq3NZp2op5Riu7DAjKKlnaGRo3qxsc6po55lYmV%2Bc3%2BPbmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
