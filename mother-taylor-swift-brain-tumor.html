This Tuesday, 21 January 2019, Variety magazine released a cover story on Taylor Swift. In this article, the singer has talked about her mother, Andrea’s battle with breast cancer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Andrea1.jpg><p>The singer Taylor revealed that doctors diagnosed a tumor in the brain of her mother when she was under treatment for her previously diagnosed cancer. Taylor states:</p><p>“The symptoms of what a person goes through when they have a brain tumor is nothing like what we’ve ever been through with her cancer before. So it’s just been a really hard time for us as a family.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Taylor_Swift%E2%80%99s_article_in_Elle></span>Taylor Swift’s article in Elle<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In March 2019, Taylor wrote an essay for Elle where she spoke about what she learned before her age of thirty. She said:</p><p>“Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. It’s taught me that there are real problems and then there’s everything else. My mom’s cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Andrea3.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Taylor_Swift_modifies_her_tour></span>Taylor Swift modifies her tour<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The talented Taylor is a loving daughter. She modified her tour dates in order to be with her ailing mother. She had fewer stops for her “Lover” concert tour. Talking to Billboard in December 2019, Taylor said:</p><p>“This is a year where I have to be there for my family — there’s a lot of question marks throughout the next year, so I wanted to make sure that I could go home,”</p><p>She continued:</p><p>“I mean, we don’t know what is going to happen. We don’t know what treatment we’re going to choose. It just was the decision to make at the time, for right now, for what’s going on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Andrea2.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Taylor_and_her_love_for_mom_Andrea_Swift></span>Taylor and her love for mom Andrea Swift<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Taylor loves her mom immensely. Praising her, Taylor had once said:</p><p>“Everyone loves their mom; everyone’s got an important mom. But for me, she’s really the guiding force. Almost every decision I make, I talk to her about it first. So obviously it was a really big deal to ever speak about her illness.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Short_bio_on_Taylor_Swift></span>Short bio on Taylor Swift<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Taylor Swift is an American singer-songwriter and actress best known for her narrative songs which usually describe her personal life.
