She’s got to be coming soon, though, as&nbsp;The Batman&nbsp;is set to relaunch the Dark Knight’s mythos on the big screen. Most actresses who’ve been fancast for the part tend to be Caucasian and/or red headed, but actually, the signs are pointing to director Matt Reeves likely hiring a person of color for the character.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>After all, Jeffrey Wright is set to play Jim Gordon, Babs’ father, in The Batman, and this has inspired fan artist Mizuri to now imagine what Spider-Man&nbsp;star Zendaya would look like if she was chosen to play Batgirl opposite Robert Pattinson’s Bruce Wayne. You can check out their work down below and we must say, the actress would certainly fit the role well if she were to be selected for it.</p><p>“With Jeffrey Wright as Jim Gordon in the Matt Reeves’ Batverse, I reckon [Zendaya] could be a badass Barbara Gordon,” the artist said in their caption on the Instagram post. “The idea came to me after seeing the epic Dune trailer with [Timothy Chalamet] as my top pick for Robin (Grayson). Hope you like it!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Zendaya-Batgirl-The-Batman-Fan-Art.jpg><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>As Mizuri reminds us, Zendaya is set to appear in another major upcoming Warner Bros. blockbuster, Denis Villeneuve’s Dune,&nbsp;alongside DCEU star Jason Momoa, which is coming out next October. She also features in HBO’s Euphoria as well. So, the actress does already have a working relationship with the studio, which could lead to a DC role like Batgirl. She also has commitments to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though, so she might be too busy to don Barbara’s cowl. At least, anytime in the near future.</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>But tell us, do you like the idea of Zendaya being cast as The Batman‘s <strong>Batgirl</strong>? If not, who would be your ideal choice for the heroine?
