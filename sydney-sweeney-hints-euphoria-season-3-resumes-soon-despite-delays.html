A second season dropped in 2022, <a href=#>leaving fans clamoring</a> for more.</p><p class=p1><i>Euphoria </i>season 3 was initially planned to premiere in 2025 before facing an array of <a href=#>significant delays</a>. Show creator<strong> Sam Levinson</strong> was previously wrapped up in his short-lived series <i>The Idol </i>while cast members <strong>Zendaya</strong>, <strong>Jacob Elordi</strong> and Sweeney alike booked a steady stream of projects in the interim. The 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes further exacerbated the length of the production hiatus.</p><p class=p1>An HBO spokesperson later revealed in March that the network and Levinson, 39, remained “committed” to producing season 3. The statement added, “In the interim, we are allowing our in-demand cast to <a href=#>pursue other opportunities</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sydney-Sweeney-Hints-Euphoria-Season-3-Will-Resume-Relatively-Soon-With-Wild-Story-Lines.jpg><p class=p1>Sweeney, for her part, stressed to <i>Who What Wear </i>that she wasn’t worried about <a href=#>the significant filming gap</a>. “I actually like it because there’s so much room for growth for both me as a person and also Cassie as a character,” she explained.</p><p class=p1>Sweeney had noted to the outlet that she is “very, very deep in the trenches with a lot of projects,” including a remake of <strong>Jane Fonda</strong>’s <i>Barbarella </i>and several producing opportunities under her Fifty-Fifty Films production company’s umbrella. The actress also recently starred in thriller <i>Immaculate </i>and romantic comedy <i>Anyone But You</i>, the latter of which grossed over $200 million at the worldwide box office. (Sweeney and fiancé <strong>Jonathan Davino</strong> coproduced <i>Anyone But You</i>, in which she also starred alongside actor <strong>Glen Powell</strong>.)</p><p class=p1>Regardless of the project, Sweeney takes her craft very seriously.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I signed up to be an actress so I could give people characters and stories. I just [craft] their story from the ground up,” she added to <i>Who What Wear</i>.</p><p class=p1>Sweeney’s method for acting begins with writing diaries of notes for each character.</p><p class=p1>“Yeah, so these books are basically like a journal diary map to all of my characters from the day they’re born until the first page of the script,” she said on <a href=# rel=noopener><i>The Drew Barrymore Show </i></a>in January 2022. “I take everything I can from the script and then I build and fill in all the gaps about why she is the way she is today and what memories led her to hold herself the way that she holds herself or sit the way she sits. It’s just like this really cool, creative development process to build a person. Just like we are all people with different memories that create who we are today. I take the same approach to a character.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqynJ6axm6%2F1p6cp52pYrWqutOsZJ6toJ28s7XAZqqemaOku25%2FjKucrK2dmsBuv86opWaclai9qsDEZpuepJGuwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
