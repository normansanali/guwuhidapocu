The KB395L definitely stands out, as it is one of the very few mechanical keyboards using such short travel switches.</p><p>In terms of overall quality, the HAVIT KB395L is not the kind of keyboard that you want to rage punch or daily abuse. In order to make the keyboard lightweight and thin, the designers had to limit the thickness of the plastic underside of the keyboard. Furthermore, the stems of these Kailh switches and the keycaps are quite fragile and will not withstand too much force. Considering that replacements will be very hard to come by, it would be wise to treat the KB395L with respect.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/11632/havit_kb395l_11_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Aesthetically, the KB395L stands out via its minimalism. The dimensions of the top aluminum plate have been reduced to barely fit the standard layout keyboard and only the company’s logo between the arrow and control keys stands out. One could say that it strongly resembles Apple’s keyboards, only with superior mechanical switches and a black color scheme. The RGB lighting is generally good, with minimal bleed around the keycaps, but its application on the Space Bar key could definitely have been better.</p><p>Kailh’s new PG1350 blue switch makes the KB395L practically ideal for professionals that like tactile switches. It is soft and very comfortable, probably even more than all classic mechanical keyboard switches. The audible feedback is not too loud and should not disturb people who are not in the immediate vicinity of the user, neither tire the users themselves out after long typing sessions.</p><p>The company markets the KB395L as a “both games and office” keyboard. We would say that it strongly inclines towards the latter, as its comfort and minimalistic design are more suited to professional use. Professionals will love its tactile, audible feedback and the long-term comfort that Kailh’s new switches offer. It is not a bad choice for gamers but it has little to offer other than long-term comfort, while other <a href=#>similarly priced products</a> are definitely better suited for gaming. The current retail price of the KB395L is $80, which may be a little high for a keyboard using Kailh switches and lacking in advanced features, but we would not go as far as to claim that it is overpriced considering that it currently is one-of-a-kind design. Its tenkeyless version, <a href=#>the KB390L</a>, is available for $20 less, but note that it also lacks the RGB backlighting of the KB395L.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH5ygpJrZqGZpp7BbrfBbHBupF2ntKN5zJ6aoWWbmsaju8Crm2aqlau2psOObg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
