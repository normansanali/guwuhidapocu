He can touch me anytime he wants, and I hope he does. That is what a healthy, good marriage and relationship is all about.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Cameron Bure explained to Us Weekly exclusively that her and the retired athlete’s <a href=#>20-year-old son, Lev, took the picture</a> after they had lunch together.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[We saw] that cute little bridge. I thought, ‘Oh, honey. Let’s take a picture together.’ And after, you know, 10 photos, he put his hand there. It was the last picture we took,” she said. “When we looked through, we both laughed and we were like, ‘That one’s so funny. Let’s post it.’ And then it blew up on the internet.”</p><p>Days later, the Hallmark Channel star — who also shares daughter Natasha, 22, and son Maksim, 18, with Bure — <a href=#>called sex “the blessing of marriage”</a> during an appearance on the “Confessions of a Crappy Christian” podcast.</p><p>“I hate when Christians are like, no, you have to pretend like you’ve never had sex, and we only know that you’ve had sex three times because you’ve had three children,” she said. “If we are to promise ourselves for one another and preach saving yourself for marriage, then sex needs to be celebrated within marriage.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacmZ6ZrqSxjJyYpp2ipLturtSrnGaqlauyorjSZp%2Bor12gtqW%2FjJ%2BcnqRdlq%2BwwdNmn56qXaiyuXnCqKSmnZ6pwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
