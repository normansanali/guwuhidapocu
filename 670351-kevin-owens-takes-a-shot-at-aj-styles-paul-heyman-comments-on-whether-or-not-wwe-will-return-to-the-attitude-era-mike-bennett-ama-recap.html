ROH was my family, they all came to my wedding, and I was leaving my family for the last 6 years. then the Philly crowd was just unbelievable. I debuted in that very building, and every fan that night told me to quit. then fast forward to my last night and they chanted thank you and please don’t go. Philly made it one of the greatest nights of my life.”</p><p>On working for Jim Cornette:</p><p>“Cornette was extremely influential on me getting signed by ROH, I spent a good 2 years learning under him and he was always very honest and fair. he always treated me very well, so ill never say a bad thing about him. everyone has different reasons to not like someone or like them, and ill always respect that.”</p><p>On a possible working relationship between TNA and ROH:</p><p>“I hope it can start to bridge a gap. I think it would be the best for pro wrestling. the matches would be awesome. its def. one of my goals is to get the two companies working together. because I know the talent and TNA are all for it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgpZpam5pXaCyt7XNZqawnZ6oerWtyp6qZpldqLWwwIyaq2aZmmLAtcXLnqpmqJGquW60xLKkmqZdmLyuucSnq6xln6N6uLTErZ%2Beql2kv266zq1ksK%2BVYsSquMtmqZ6spae7bsDOZquhnV2WwbW1066bnmWVp65uuciknGaalaO7psDTZpimmV2nsqStzw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
