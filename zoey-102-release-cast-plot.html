That being said, Zoey 102 is expected to release this summer, exclusively through Paramount +. Although an official date has yet to be announced, it is exciting to know that the wait is almost over.</p><p>The film might be an official reunion, but it is worth mentioning that this isn't the first time that the cast got together after Zoey 101. A few members of the original ensemble reunited for a short where they opened the time capsules that their characters buried in the show 10 years prior.</p><p>Spears wasn't part of the short, but she joined the cast for a sketch called "Thelma Stump" in All That <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2019</a> and later in 2020 to shoot a music video. The video featured none other than the show's iconic theme song, "Follow Me". <strong>Chantel Jeffries</strong>,<strong> JoJo Siwa</strong>, and more participated in the music video, pretending to audition for a Zoey 101 reboot. See how it turned out in the video below:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-there-a-trailer-for-zoey-102>Is There a Trailer for Zoey 102?</h2><p>We received our first trailer for Zoey 102 on June 20, 2023.

Throughout the seasons, the characters would embark on many adventures together at the boarding school. Now that everyone is grown up, Zoey 102 will follow these beloved former students in a high school/wedding reunion. Here is what the film will be about, according to Paramount +:</p><p>"Over a decade after the iconic series ended, Zoey Brooks is still trying to figure out life and love, this time in her 20s. The Pacific Coast Academy (PCA) gang returns to Malibu for an over-the-top wedding turned high school reunion for the books."</p><p>Is it possible that Zoey and Chase are the ones tying the knot?
