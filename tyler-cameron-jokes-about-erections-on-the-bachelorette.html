I was able to keep everything under control there. I was proud of myself.”</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>However, the general contractor wasn’t so lucky after it happened again when he and the former Miss Alabama USA, 25, were on a date in Latvia.&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I had those tight, way too small pants on,” he said. “We were making out and they were like, ‘Alright, guys, we have to go, we have to go. I was like ‘No.’ And then finally they made us go, and I was like, ‘Well, now I have a boner and all of America is going to see it.’ And she’s like, ‘Do I need to go in front of you?’ And I was like, ‘No, I’m just going to show it off.’”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Though Cameron didn’t hide his arousal from the cameras, his bulge didn’t make the final cut of the episode, which he was relieved about. The reality star isn’t the first<i> Bachelorette </i>contestant to talk about pitching a tent on-screen. In a previous episode of the “Bachelor Party” podcast, season 20<a href=#> <span class=s2>Bachelor</span></a><a href=#> <span class=s2><b>Ben Higgins</b></span></a> also revealed that he got a boner as he made out with runner-up<a href=#> <span class=s2><b>JoJo Fletcher</b></span></a> under a waterfall in Jamaica. The difference is that Higgins said his erection actually made it on air.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Way to go, Ben,” Cameron said.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The former NFL player was the runner-up on Brown’s season of <i>The Bachelorette</i>. On the season 15 finale in August, the Alabama native — who broke up with winner<a href=#> <span class=s2><b>Jed Wyatt</b></span></a> earlier in the episode after news broke that<a href=#> <span class=s2>he had a secret girlfriend</span></a> — asked<a href=#> <span class=s2>Cameron out for drinks</span></a>. The model was<a href=#> <span class=s2>photographed leaving Brown’s home</span></a> in Los Angeles three days later.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Two days after his sleepover at Brown’s house, Cameron was<a href=#> <span class=s2>seen on a date</span></a> with<a href=#><b> </b><span class=s2><b>Gigi Hadid</b></span></a><b> </b>at Brooklyn’s Dumbo House. The two went public<a href=#> <span class=s2>as a couple</span></a> at an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty in August.&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Despite the appearances, Cameron told <i>Entertainment Tonight</i> earlier this month that he and the supermodel, 24,<a href=#> <span class=s2>aren’t official</span></a>.&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“We’re just friends,” he said. “I mean … that’s just where we’re at. Our relationship doesn’t need to be public. She’s good people, she’s an amazing person and we’re just keeping it friendly. … We have a great time together.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The <i>Bachelorette</i> alum explained that his televised relationship with Brown has made him more protective over his love life.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I’m at the point where I don’t really want to talk about my relationships. I’ve dated publicly, so … I’m trying to date privately,” he told <i>ET</i>.&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As for Brown, the former beauty queen told <i>Us Weekly</i> in August that she’s<a href=#> <span class=s2>put dating on hold</span></a> to concentrate on competing on season 28 of<a href=#> <span class=s2><i>Dancing With the Stars</i></span></a>. The<i> Bachelor</i> alum is partnered with professional dancer<a href=#> <span class=s2><b>Alan Bersten</b></span></a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I have blocked [romance] out right now.” she said. “I’m focusing on Hannah and working on continuing to get stronger and I’m excited for <i>Dancing With the Stars</i> to continue telling my story in a different way, and that doesn’t mean looking to find a partner. There’s more to Hannah than that.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatsZyav26vwKacq6eeYrewt8SsZJqan6rBbrHRnpqtoZ%2BjwG67zWaroZ1dl66ktMSlpqudpKmycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
