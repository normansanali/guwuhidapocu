He has been racing dirt motorcycles since he was four years old and has been in several accidents.

He is now seeking a partner after settling down professionally. That is why Jordan has joined The Bachelorette season 19 in search of an ideal match who is “mature, independent, interesting, and eager to have a huge family” since Jordan wants a “lot of kids.”&nbsp;Jordan’s favorite move requires his spouse to “enjoy the unpredictability and be ready to receive flowers on any odd day of the week.”</p><p>Despite the fact that he is from Florida and enjoys the state, he “hates Florida drivers.” Jordan’s favorite holiday is the Fourth of July. Jordan earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (Management Information Systems) from West Virginia University in 2009. He subsequently started working as a.NET Software Developer at Global Data Consultants in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. He moved on to PNC Financial Services after more than a year of experience, where he worked as a Software Engineer for a year and five months. Jordan then joined Simplexity in August 2012 as a Content Developer in Reston, VA, and after six months there, he joined BAM Technologies as a Software Developer, where he has remained since 2013.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jordan-Helman-3.jpg alt="Jordan Helman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Season 19 of The Bachelorette</h2><p>The first episode of the program will premiere on Monday, with Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia reuniting after The Bachelor to pursue love.&nbsp;The attributes that the main women want in their spouses will be revealed in the first episode.
