Whether it be the brightness of a screen illuminating everyone around them, the desire to check social media at the expense of what’s happening on the screen or somebody answering a call in the middle of a packed house, it can often end up ruining the theatrical experience for many paying customers.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Apparently, Adam Sandler didn’t get the memo because the actor revealed in a recent interview that when he took a trip to the movies with his family to catch <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong></a>, he ended up calling Jim Carrey right there and then to let him know how much he was enjoying the rubber-faced funnyman’s performance as the scenery-chewing Doctor Robotnik.</p><p>“I called Carrey from the theater. I was telling him how funny he was while it was going on. I didn’t know it would be the last movie I ever saw at a movie theater. People were spread out. There were only a few of us in the theater, and I was laughing very loud. The people behind us were laughing, too. So I think out last big night out was Sonic.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sonic-the-Hedgehog-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sonic-poster-1.jpg><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=822 data-injectable=true>Audiences generally tend to disapprove of other patrons making phone-calls in the middle of a movie, even if the person in question is a famous actor with a reported net worth of almost half a billion dollars that just happens to have the star on speed-dial and decides to let him know in real-time how much of a good job he’s doing. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maybe Sandler just forgot the protocol given that the vast majority of his output goes straight to streaming these days</a>?</p><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=false>Questionable theater etiquette aside, Sandler wasn’t wrong, because Carrey was easily<strong> Sonic the Hedgehog</strong>‘s standout performer in a cast full of bland and formulaic characters, with his manic turn as Robotnik reminiscent of his mid-90s heyday as one of the world’s most popular movie stars. And based on the post-credits scene, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all signs point to his return in the sequel being even more over the top</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomJ2ZnWLAorrDpZyrZZOWua2xw2ahoqVdmK6zvsSyZK2glZbBpr6MpaavnZRiwLC6yJxkoZ2UnLKpu8Zo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
