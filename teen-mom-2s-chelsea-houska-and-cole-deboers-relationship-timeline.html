Less than two years later, they became a family of five when Chelsea and Cole welcomed daughter Layne on her 27th birthday.</p><p>Chelsea gushed about life as a mother of three in February 2019.</p><p>“I feel like [Layne] is like Cole. I think Aubree is like me and Watson and Layne are like Cole,” she told<a href=#> E! News </a>at the time about her youngest daughter. ”She’s very laid back. She’s easy, she’s smiley, she’s chill, very chill.”</p><p>The reality star also gave credit to Aubree and her husband.</p><p>“Having Aubree’s help has been amazing. She loves helping. She plays with her brother when I need her to,” Chelsea told the outlet. “I mean, Cole is just great all around. I’m more of the laid-back parent and he’s definitely more paranoid and worried all the time, which is funny because it’s usually the mom, but I mean, he’s so helpful. He changes diapers. He gets in there. He does it all.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll through for Chelsea and Cole’s relationship timeline:</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bpsqa6jKampmViqHqktMSlqp6ZXZ28tr%2FKmmSappRisLC4xGabnpqfmr%2B0edGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWStoZ2auaq6xGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
