After being in a position of honor that allowed her to interview many of these incredibly talented people, and in many cases, gave her an opportunity to befriend them, she turned on anyone and everyone that she could fire off on. Couric didn't hesitate to spill the tea on what <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a> was really like behind the scenes, and not a single aspect of her story seemed very 'royal' at all.</p><h2 id=katie-couric-spills-all>Katie Couric Spills All</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it was revealed that Katie Couric was releasing a memoir, most presumed it would center around her personal feelings and her career in the spotlight, inclusive of the various ways she was affected by the important people that she was fortunate enough to meet.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>She took a different turn, and instead, Couric used her memoir as a platform to roast some of the people she met, leaving no name guarded, and nothing held sacred.
