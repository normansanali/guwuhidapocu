I mean, look at me! But fitting in was never something I really worried about because I knew early on I was born to stand out. So, I did my own thing and ignored anyone who wanted me to conform. Embracing my oddities, snakes and all, has taken me far. From the Super Bowl to this very stage. That's right! Technically, I've been here before. But this time, I'm here to compete, and The Masked Singer feels like the perfect stage for me because honestly? Look around. It doesn't get much weirded than this."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>The clue package also contained the following clues:</p><ul><li>A chess board</li><li>A tattoo of a flaming heart with the words "True Love" on it</li><li>A set of scales with a picture of Buckingham Palace on one side and what looks to be an old-fashioned car (or maybe a carriage) on the other</li><li>One of Medusa's snakes spitting out black venom</li><li>Saturn</li></ul><p>Medusa's Swag Bag Clue was a DVD box for Medusa: Snakes on the Astral Plane with a note saying "$340 million sold!"

They performed “Someone Like You” by Adele who is also a mother!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Fans loved Medusa’s performance of “Take Me to Church” by Hozier on May 10.
