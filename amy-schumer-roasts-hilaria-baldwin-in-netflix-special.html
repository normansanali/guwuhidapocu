During their interaction, Schumer said that the Massachusetts native told her she was “from España” and used a “thick Spanish accent.”</p><p>“[Hilaria and Alec] have a Von Trapp amount of children, and they named them all ― I’m not sure, but very Spanish names like Jamón, Croqueta and Flamenco,” the Trainwreck actress quipped. “And all of this would be fine and beautiful, except that ‘Hilaria from España’ is actually Hillary from Boston. This woman is in no way Spanish. Her parents are not from Spain. No one in her life is from Spain. You’re going, ‘What?!’ Did you think I was just doing a really racist Spanish impression?”</p><p>Before the couple wed in 2012, the entrepreneur — who was born in Boston — was known as Hillary Hayward-Thomas up until 2009. In their decade-long marriage, Hilaria and Alec, 65, have welcomed <a href=#>seven children</a>: Carmen, 9, Rafael, 7, Leonardo, 6, Romeo, 4, Eduardo, 2, Lucia, 2 months, and Ilaria, 9 months. (The <a href=#>Beetlejuice</a> actor, for his part, is also father to daughter <strong><a href=#>Ireland</a></strong>, 27, with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Kim Basinger</strong></a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Amy-Schumer-Pokes-Fun-at-Hilaria-Baldwin-and-Her-Von-Trapp-Amount-of-Kids-3.jpg><p>“So, I’m not trying to bully a sociopath. I have a point, OK? I think what had happened was [that] she went to Spain. And I’ve been lucky enough to go to Spain. Some of you have been. It’s great, right? Don’t you love it? I loved it, too. But Hillary from Boston … loooved it! I am going to be from it!”</p><p>In 2020, Hilaria came under fire for allegedly <a href=#>appropriating Spanish culture</a>. Following the backlash, Hilaria sat down with the <a href=#>New York Times</a> in December 2020 to <a href=#>share her side of the story</a>.</p><p>“I was born in Boston. I spent time in Boston and in Spain. My family now lives in Spain,” she explained. “I moved to New York when I was 19 years old and I have lived here ever since. For me, I feel like I have spent 10 years sharing that story over and over again. And now it seems like it’s not enough.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Most recently, the Baldwin family has faced a series of legal woes following the tragic 2021 shooting that <a href=#>occurred on the set</a> of Alec’s movie Rust. The actor fired a prop gun that <a href=#>injured the director</a> and killed cinematographer <a href=#>Halyna Hutchins</a>. The 30 Rock alum was <a href=#>charged with involuntary manslaughter</a>.</p><p>In April 2023 the <a href=#>charges were dropped</a>. After the news broke, Alec penned a touching tribute to his wife. “I owe everything I have to this woman,” he wrote via Instagram at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapaliwKS01Kacq2WipK60wNJmn6Kkkae2onnBmqOdr5mjeqq6jKecrZ6cnsVuv8%2BemqKZnGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
