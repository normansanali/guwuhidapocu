GOP rips 'Maserati Manchin's ritzy lifestyle and $1M fine dining bi</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>DAVOS, SWITZERLAND:&nbsp;Senator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Manchin</a>, a conservative Democrat, is already being targeted by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) before he has even declared whether he will run for re-election in 2024.</p><p>The GOP campaign for Senate just released an ad titled "Maserati Manchin" featuring Manchin's expensive car and $700,000 houseboat and that Manchin spent more than $1 million of campaign donations on upscale restaurants. The 75-year-old conservative appears to be his party's only candidate to retain the West <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Virginia</a> Senate seat, and the ad is apparently intended to discourage him from running. The ad states, "Life's very good for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Democrat</a> Joe Manchin. While West Virginians get stuck with higher prices, smaller paychecks, open borders." The ad includes the phrase "Joe Manchin, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Biden</a>, living it up" and a picture of clinking champagne glasses.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>What is Service Restoration Act?

It said, "Instead of working in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">West Virginia</a>, Joe Manchin is hanging out in Switzerland."</p><p>Manchin has remained quiet about his intentions for 2024, although he hinted on Sunday, January 22, that he might run for president. Asked by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DailyMail</a> on Tuesday, January 24, when the public should learn more about his plans, he said, "Probably 2024"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/2a7addcd-3cc7-44ee-b7cb-29c90c19abd7.1345167147><p>The politician made the remark after Cook Political Report's first Senate ratings for 2024 were released and Manchin's seat was rated "toss-up" alongside independent Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Machin, however, said he would not run for governor, which he held from 2005 to 2010.</p><h2 class=split>What is Joe Manchin's net worth?</h2><p>Joe Manchin is projected to have a net worth of $8 million and an annual salary of $700,000 in 2023, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fimlysiyappa</a>. His main source of income is the emoluments he receives from the United States as a Senator.</p><p>Manchin also generates income through the company he founded in 1988. In addition, he has financial backing from Emerald Coast Realty, which operates a La Quinta in Elkview, West Virginia. The Manchin Docks houseboat in Washington, DC, was reportedly purchased in 2014 for $220,000; its market value is $700,000. Enersystems accounts for 30 per cent of Machin's net worth and 71 per cent of his investment income.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoop%2Baeq6tzZyfoqZdo7K1edaoqa2gXaeyscHBpaCcmZ6oere71maumqpdoq60sdGaq6JlnZa7pLTIp2SdmaakwA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
