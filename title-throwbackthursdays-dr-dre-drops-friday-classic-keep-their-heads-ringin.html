That era of Hip Hop was second to none and produced countless classic albums. From <a href=# rel=noopener>Dr. Dre’s</a>The Chronic to<a href=#> Snoop Dogg’s</a>Doggystyle and everything in between, the 90s definitely kept those heads ringin.</p><p>On March 7, 1995, Dre dropped a bomb on the Friday soundtrack called “Keep Their Heads Ringin” featuring vocals from singer&nbsp;Nanci Fletcher. Samples were derived from The Sequence cut “Funk You Up,” which was released in 1980 via Sugar Hill Records.</p><p>The song was a commercial hit, peaking at&nbsp;No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart.</p><p></p><p>The accompanying video was directed by F. Gary Gray — who would go on to direct the history-making <a href=#>Straight Outta Compton</a> biopic in 2015 — and starred&nbsp;Friday actors&nbsp;Chris Tucker, Faizon Love and Nia Long.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Set in an airplane hanger, the visual finds Dre and crew taking over the airport controller’s communication system in order to play the Friday film.</p><p></p><p>Although the Friday soundtrack was put out on Priority Records, Death Row Records currently owns the masters. The album includes 15 tracks by artists such as Scareface, Ice Cube, <a href=#>Cypress Hill,</a> Mack 10, 2 Live Crew and Rick James.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The album was released in April 1995 and certified double platinum by the RIAA in June 1996.</p><p>Since its release, Friday has become a cult classic and helped launch Cube’s lucrative film career. Cube is currently <a href=#>shooting another installment</a> of the franchise called Last Friday. He&nbsp;confirmed the news during an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2017.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“We’re working on one right now,” Cube said. “We’re gonna call it Last Friday.”</p><p>No release date has been confirmed as of yet.</p><p>Until it surfaces, revisit the original soundtrack above and keep that head ringin.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZlZYJ1go6toK2klWPBqb7OsJmam5uptba%2B0p2Ysqtdmb9usNGeZJ2qn6XAbrLRopuasV2YuaK%2F0qKaZqOVmr1uwMeeoKtlmJqupb%2BMq6Cnn5mj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
