She and the musician, 35, walked into the event hand in hand.</p><p>The couple, who <a href=#>tied the knot in 2013</a>, already share their 4-year-old daughter, <a href=#>Edie</a>.</p><p>In September 2018, Knightley joked to Us Weekly exclusively that she hadn’t slept in “three years” since <a href=#>welcoming her baby girl</a>. “[Edie] has occasionally slept through the night, but not in any kind of prolonged sense,” she told Us at the time. But since the actress herself didn’t sleep through the night until she was 6 years old, she admitted, her “mum is thrilled because she says it’s comeuppance.”</p><p>While the Golden Globe nominee&nbsp;keeps Edie pretty private, she has gushed about her girl multiple times. In 2015, she detailed the “astonishing” love she had for her little one to <a href=#>Elle</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s a very primal, primal love. That’s quite extraordinary,” Knightley told the magazine at the time. “And the ability to have no sleep and continue going. It’s not pleasant — I never thought that I could actually do it for the amount of time that I’ve done it.”</p><p>The model hasn’t just been surprised by her stamina, though. She&nbsp;told<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Inquirer</a> about the unexpected effect motherhood had on her acting career in March 2019.</p><p>“I think I play everything now that I’m different,” she said at the time. “Obviously, it just has an impact on your point of view about everything. Certainly, a woman who doesn’t have a child could play a part and do a perfectly good job, but I think there are certainly nuances that the experience brings to you that I might not have thought about before I had a kid.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaknZmnrm63zaKeoaycmsZus8ivnKxlkp6%2FtbSMsJylm5%2BisrR5kaebZpqRl8Zuw8itn2aikaKytHnRop6hrJ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
