With her at the center of the show,&nbsp;<i>New Girl</i>&nbsp;is a flat circle. Season one was the story of a newly single, late-20s-to-early-30-something who has to be resocialized by her quirky male roommates. The first few episodes of that season, you may recall, are nearly unwatchable. Jess is less a lovable goofball and more a twee, socially stunted alien. The show never quite got a handle on how to make Zooey Deschanel “undateable” without making her outright cloying, so it reinvented itself as an ensemble piece. The tail end of season one through season two were undeniably the best of what&nbsp;<i>New Girl</i>&nbsp;has to offer because they took the brunt of the show’s relationship-centric material off Jess’s shoulders.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-4-0-0@published data-word-count=38>Since the show runs into problems when it goes out of its way to lend credence to the idea of a gorgeous, happy-go-lucky, middle-school vice-principal having dating problems, why doesn’t it just relegate Jess to a supporting character?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-5-0-0@published data-word-count=55>At this point, no one is watching the show <i>just</i> for Zooey Deschanel anyway. <i>Just</i> for Jake Johnson, maybe, or <i>just</i> for Max Greenfield. But Jess isn’t anyone’s favorite character, so maybe it’s time she abdicates her throne as the Newest Girl of Them All, especially when there is such an obvious, worthy successor: Cece.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-6-0-0@published data-word-count=79>Cece is the most compelling character on the show right now. She’s gone through a failed relationship, a failed engagement, a failed rebound, and a failed career. She’s got a potential romantic interest, but more pressing, she’s got a bunch of big life decisions to make, any one of which could anchor a show. Not to mention the fact that she’s played by the criminally underutilized Hannah Simone, who’s created a three-dimensional person out of a “sassy best friend.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-7-0-0@published data-word-count=74>It didn’t occur to me until “Dice” just how little I’ve cared about a <i>New Girl </i>A-story in a long, long time. The episode starts with Jess asking Schmidt to teach her how to use Dice, a Tinder knockoff that Schmidt insists would eat Jess alive. He eventually, inexplicably relents, and spends most of the episode coaching Jess along as she sweetly bumbles her way through a ten-date series Schmidt calls the “Dice diez.”</p><h2 class=related-stories-title data-editable=title>Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-5vosY1vP"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>True or False Quiz: Did Winston Do This Crazy Thing on <i>New Girl</i>?</span></a> <a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-qcH8gLz1"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Max Greenfield on <i>New Girl</i> Season 4 and Weddings</span></a> <a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-oIDbTPwE"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Jake Johnson Is the Greatest Drunk Actor of Our Time</span></a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-9-0-0@published data-word-count=136>Jess has been dating for a long time now. Moreover, she’s been dating under Schmidt’s tutelage for almost four years. The technology used to make said dates happen is irrelevant; the fact is, we’ve seen this story before, and it’s really never worked. The specifics of Schmidt’s seemingly arbitrary opinions and Max Greenfield’s line delivery are as pitch-perfect as ever (“The only acceptable pet for a man to have is a saltwater fish”), but the whole thing accomplishes almost nothing. By the end of this particular story, we’ve learned that Jess prefers love to random hookups and that she has trouble saying “no” to people. It’s like those zero-calorie, zero-carb shirataki Miracle Noodles — it looks and feels fine, I guess, but by the end of it, I have no recollection of what I just consumed.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-10-0-0@published data-word-count=26>With that out of the way, let’s talk about the best thing to happen to <i>New Girl </i>in a very, very long time: stoned Nick Miller.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-11-0-0@published data-word-count=35>Thank you, comedy gods, for Jake Johnson. He’s long since been <a href=#>crowned the King of Acting Drunk</a>, but in “Dice,” he does the seemingly impossible and gives a convincing portrayal of someone very, very stoned.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-12-0-0@published data-word-count=132>I’m actually surprised we’ve never seen the characters on <i>New Girl</i> “take pot” (Nick’s words, not mine) before — they’re young and intoxicant-friendly and living in California. Perhaps the more widespread marijuana legalization becomes, the more we’ll see sitcoms get comfortable with recreational pot use without turning it into a “very special episode.” If and when that’s the world we live in, I think we’ll have a better perspective on just how impressive Jake Johnson’s performance in “Dice” really is. Convincingly acting stoned is a nigh impossible task, as the nuances of it are different for everyone, and the fact that Jake Johnson manages to so clearly identify the subtle differences between drunk Nick and stoned Nick is further proof that he might secretly be giving the best comedic performance on television.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-13-0-0@published data-word-count=52>One thing I genuinely loved about this episode was the simplicity with which it handled the B story. Coach has never tried weed, so Cece and Nick make pot brownies. Unfortunately, Winston has just gotten them all invited to a barbecue hosted by some of his new friends from the police academy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-14-0-0@published data-word-count=81>If the only reason <i>New Girl</i> ever sent Winston to the police academy was to have an excuse to throw a very stoned Nick, Cece, and Coach into a sea of cops, then I take back everything I ever said about how insane a move that was by the show. It’s the cleanest, most classic comedy formula <i>New Girl</i>’s used in a long time, and it plays out like what <i>Three’s Company </i>might look like if it were rebooted for millennials.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-15-0-0@published data-word-count=58>The scenes of Cece, Coach, and Nick just hanging out, stoned, talking about Titanic made me honestly sad that there isn’t a world in which this could be all <i>New Girl </i>is. Has there ever been a hangout sitcom that is literally nothing but watching people hanging out? Because I’d watch that. And you know you would, too.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-16-0-0@published data-word-count=44>I would be remiss to talk about this episode without absolutely raving about Lamorne Morris’s delivery of “They kicked over the grill and then they ran that way!” I had to pause the episode while I cracked the eff up. A+. Amazing. Perfection. This.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-17-0-0@published data-word-count=50>Commendations as well to the costume and props department: Jess’s grey dress and Cece’s jumpsuit were both on point, and it is now clear that Jess’s phone case is a duck. The only thing more genius is the fact that Schmidt’s ring tone is “Somebody That I Used to Know.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-81119d22fdde26c89a69789102621ecf-18-0-0@published data-word-count=26>“Dice” was exceedingly enjoyable. But when the main character’s story line drags the rest of the episode down, clearly a show needs to reexamine its priorities.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed><i>New Girl</i> Recap: Last Piece of Pie</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobWdgbnyvsdZmnqKqnGK%2Fpq%2FAqWSsnZGovK95k2abopuVYrGiwMinnmegpKK5</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
