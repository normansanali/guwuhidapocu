Over the years, he has undergone numerous transformations and mastered the art of portraying a villain, ultimately&nbsp;flourishing as a successful heel.&nbsp;That being said it&nbsp;appears Corbin felt he was drowning after his failed run with JBL.</p><p>After his initial success as a despised villain, Baron Corbin’s persona was rebranded as Happy Corbin, which only fueled the flames of fan hatred. He later disappeared from WWE programming, only to resurface as Baron Corbin alongside JBL.</p><p>However, JBL abandoned Baron Corbin on RAW, and the WWE Hall of Famer is not expected to make an appearance on WWE television anytime soon. In fact,&nbsp;<a href=#>Triple H abandoned the Corbin storyline altogether</a>.</p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">After The Bell</a>, Baron Corbin talked about his failed alliance with JBL. Corbin revealed that he felt he was drowning after the partnership ended.</p><p>“When we got to the end of the JBL stuff, we were trying to make it work, but I just think there were a few things that went against us. Opportunity and timing and a few other things. And you could feel it. I felt like I was in a movie, stuck out in the ocean and waiting to get eaten by sharks. I was drowning, in a sense. And that’s when we had the conversation. ‘Okay, what do we do?'”</p><p>Baron Corbin was also a free agent after the WWE Draft and fans wondered what would become of him.<a href=#>&nbsp;Corbin then made his shocking return to NXT in&nbsp;</a>May. Corbin is now a full-time NXT Superstar and he is fully focused on becoming a better WWE Superstar in the developmental brand. We’ll have to wait and see what’s next in store for Corbin.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your take on this story?
