Okay, that’s a lot of people, but we’re glad everyone made it here, because we have some super exciting news. We spotted one of the cutest bags the brand has ever designed on major sale. Seriously major. This bag is 45% off right now, bringing it down under $100!</p><p>This <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Jacobs crossbody bag</a> is baguette style. What does that mean? Baguette bags are small and compact, the perfect lightweight companion to carry with us wherever, whenever. Recognize the style? It was actually popularized by Sex and the City when Carrie Bradshaw (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong></a>) began wearing one!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MJ-Crossbody.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Jacobs crossbody bag</a> (originally $169) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$92</a> at YOOX!</strong></p><p>This mini bag is small, but not too small. It’s still nearly eight inches wide and six inches high! It’s a great size for carrying our daily essentials, like our wallet, keys, phone, a lipstick or two and maybe some makeup wipes. It’s crossbody style, so we can keep everything we need safely by our side!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This bag</a> has a structured half-moon shape, proving that it’s not just about functionality, but style too. A winning combination, always! It’s made of a leather-look, textured material in a precious pale pink. This light blush shade is a step up from a nude, still pairing perfectly with any other shade, but adding in that dash of pretty softness.</p><p>Contouring the shape of this bag are two parallel topstitched curving lines. At the center, toward the top of the bag, we’ll find the gold logo that reads “Marc Jacobs New York.” This logo matches the hardware of the bag, like the zip closure and strap loops. The matching goes beyond just color, though. This hardware also features the designer’s name engraved into the metal!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MJ-Crossbody-Open.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Jacobs crossbody bag</a> (originally $169) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$92</a> at YOOX!</strong></p><p>This crossbody has a stiff bottom so it can hold its own even when we can’t hold it. This not only helps our belongings lie flat on the inside, which is fully lined, but it also helps the bag stand itself up whenever we need to put it down! This way, we can keep the sides from slouching over onto dirty desks or rugs.</p><p>The crossbody strap of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this Marc Jacobs bag</a> is removable, making this bag totally customizable. If we have another strap from a different bag that fits, we can swap straps, turning this baguette bag into a shoulder bag, for example. We can also ditch the straps completely and use it as a clutch instead! It’s the perfect size that no one will question it!</p><p>YOOX has the best sales on designer brands around, so we can only imagine that this Marc Jacobs bag won’t be around for long, especially with the 45%-off sale price!</p><p>This bag is suitable for year-round wear. Anyone like Us knows it’s easy to get lazy with switching bags every other day to go with our outfit, but with this bag, that’s no longer an issue! It goes with everything and is sleek enough that we’ll actually look forward to having it top off our look every day!</p><p>Marc Jacobs bags have been and will always be a staple in designer fashion, and therefore a staple in our wardrobe. This crossbody just proves the brand’s timelessness, and we look forward to wearing it for years and years!</p><p><strong>See it: Get this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Jacobs crossbody bag</a> (originally $169) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$92</a> at YOOX!</strong></p><p><strong>Not your style?
