While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a> is not a household name just yet, he might just be the most exciting prospect among the fighters in the 155-lb. division. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>In his first three fights in the UFC, “T-Wrecks” has already proven to be must-see TV. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a> introduced himself big time in his UFC debut last year against the very tough Matt Frevola. The fighters’ entrance lasted longer than the entire fight.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>It took just seven seconds in the opening round for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a> to put Frevola to sleep with lethal precision. He threw two punches in the entire fight — a textbook one-two combination — and set the record for the fastest finish in UFC Lightweight history.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>It’s no secret that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a>&nbsp;has dynamites on those lightning-fast hands. He wasn’t even supposed to fight Frevola at UFC 263 and was just a replacement fighter for the injured Frank Camacho. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a> certainly knows how to capitalize when a massive opportunity presents itself.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>If that fight made you an instant fan, you should check out Fan Arch’s vast collection of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a>’s merchandise. You can’t go wrong with any of the merch which features awesome designs like “WinningHurts” and “Time for Bed”, and it even has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a>’s personal logo!</p><p class=p1>Following that big-time win, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a> booked a fight with Fares Ziam last February. While Frenchman gave him a much better challenge, it still ended with a first-round victory for T-Wrecks. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a> proved that he’s as dangerous on the ground as he is on the feet. He showcased his much-improved jiu-jitsu against Ziam, taking his back with ease and submitting him with a beautiful rear-naked choke.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While most fighters would gladly take the time off after a big victory like that, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a>&nbsp;is built differently. Just 14 days after his second UFC win, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a> agreed to take the injured Ricky Glenn’s place against the dangerous Drew Dober.</p><p class=p1>The Contender series alum once again got off a fast start and knocked down Dober twice in the opening minute with his ferocious striking. The resilient vet, however, relied on his experience and stormed back, rocking <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a> with a knee and punches and getting the TKO victory.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2>The loss snapped <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a>’s five-fight winning streak and derailed his hype train a bit. Still, that setback will only make <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a> a better fighter. The UFC knows they got a possible star in the making, who just needs more experience to reach his high ceiling.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The 27-year-old KO artist will now have the benefit of a full training camp, as he is slated to face Erick Gonzalez on August 6, 2022, at&nbsp;UFC Fight Night 212.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a> currently owns a respectable 12-4 record. All those wins have come by a spectacular finish, with five coming by knockouts and seven from submissions.</p><p class=p1>Let's not forget the raw emotion he shows after every win. This man endured a tough upbringing to be where he is. He wants this. He lives for this.&nbsp;</p><p class=p1><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a> is a man on a mission and a fighter on the rise. Watch out, folks. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a> will soon make it to the upper echelon of the UFC’s Lightweight division.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;We're claiming it!</span></p><p class=p1>Don’t forget to check out Fan Arch’s <a href=#>Terrance McKinney</a>-inspired merchandise and support him in his upcoming fight versus Erick Gonzales. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terrance McKinney</a> is just one of Fan Arch’s 700+ athletes from across all sports.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Fan Arch aims to transcend the narrative by making it easier to bridge the gap between athletes, influencers, and their fans.
