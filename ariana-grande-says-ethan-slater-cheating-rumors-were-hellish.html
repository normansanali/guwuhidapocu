The same month that Grande <a href=#>split from her ex-husband</a>, <strong>Dalton Gomez</strong>, news broke that she had <a href=#>begun dating</a> her <a href=#>Wicked</a> costar Slater, 31. Days later, Slater <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from wife <strong>Lilly Jay</strong>, with whom he shares a son. In August 2023, sources told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that there was no overlap between the relationships.</p><p>Grande <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Gomez, 28, in September 2023, and their <a href=#>split was finalized</a> one month later. A source exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> earlier this month that Slater and Jay are “still in the mediation phase” of their divorce, adding, “[Things] haven’t been finalized yet.”</p><p>Earlier this year, Grande seemingly called out critics of her new romance in <a href=#>“Yes, And?,”</a> the first single from her upcoming album, <a href=#>Eternal Sunshine</a>. In the track, she sings, “Your business is yours and mine is mine / Why do you care so much whose d–k I ride?”</p><p>On Monday, Grande jokingly called releasing her new album in the midst of her and Slater’s relationship drama “the absolute worst idea.” She added: “I’m so nervous, because pieces of it touch on things that are real and then pieces of it are also just, like, part of the concept. So, what is that separation?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ariana-Grande-Slams-Critics-of-Ethan-Slater-Relationship.jpg><p>Grande continued: “It’s so scary to leave it up to these selective memory people to decipher. It’s scary, but I digress. Too late. The vinyls have been printed.”</p><p>Another source exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> in October 2023 that Grande and Slater had moved in with each other. “Ethan informed his friends and soon-to-be ex-wife that he’s living with Ariana full-time in New York,” the insider shared.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The following month, Grande was spotted supporting her boyfriend at the <a href=#>opening night</a> of his Broadway show Spamalot. She returned to the show several times, even taking her dad, <strong>Ed Butera</strong>, <a href=#>to see the production</a> on Christmas Eve.</p><p>“Things between Ariana and Ethan have grown more serious in the past few months, and they’re pretty much inseparable,” an insider shared exclusively with <a href=#>Us</a> in January. “Ariana cares deeply for Ethan and absolutely sees a future with him. She’s looking forward to a fresh start in the new year and can’t wait to see how things continue to grow for them.”</p><p>Grande and Slater will share the big screen together later this year with the premiere of Wicked: Part One. Based on the Broadway musical of the same name, which is a prequel to The Wizard of Oz, Grande <a href=#>will star as Glinda the Good Witch</a> while Slater will portray Boq, a college classmate who has an unrequited crush on Glinda.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaqpmWu6J5xquYp5yVYsCixdJmnK2gkaN6tLjArZyrZZOdsqLAyKeeZqqloryzv4ywnKudXZ2yrbjIrJ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
