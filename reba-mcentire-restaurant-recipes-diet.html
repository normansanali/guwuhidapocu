She suggests cutting down on red meats and fats and instead opting for chicken, salads, and fish. She says not to stress about the weight fluctuations and exercise regularly. She also said that she enjoys fresh juice for her breakfast instead of waffles and peanut butter. At last, the singer suggests having fun with your friends and family saying, <strong>“there are things you can tell a friend that you can’t tell anyone else. It’s kind of like a therapy session.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The Fancy singer has shared that she stays away from sugar as much as she can and said, <strong>“I eat fruits and vegetables. I love salmon for my omega-3s…take supplements.

She said, <strong>“I feel 35, maybe 40. Used to be 60 years and one foot was in the grave. Now, maybe 85 is one foot, maybe 95, my momma’s 92. She still drives herself. She lives by herself. She’s spunky, and she’s frisky.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The singer has shared how she was able to drop 10 pounds in a week by getting off bread and fried foods, and now it just doesn’t work.

It’s like what Grath said one time: ‘I might not deserve it, but I’m not giving it back. It’s just that to me, they will always be the queens.”</strong></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunC4yJ%2BcraeUlsZwvsSbmGalk5q7tbXRnmSrnaOprra%2BwKerZqqVmLaxsdJmm6KdpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
