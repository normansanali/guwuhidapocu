It’s been great.”</p><p>Decker also admitted to having “no idea” if she’s interested in having more kids with her husband, <a href=#><strong>Andy Roddick</strong></a>, <a href=#>who she wed in 2009</a>.</p><p>Decker and the retired tennis star, 37, welcomed <a href=#>son Hank, 4, in 2015</a> and <a href=#>daughter Stevie, 2, in 2017</a>. In March 2019, the Just Go With It actress told Us what <a href=#>her postpartum weight loss</a> was like after giving birth to her children.</p><p>“I was one of the women who lost a lot of weight after having children,” she shared at the time. “Before I had children, I had boobs and a body, and I was curvy. And then I had children, and after breastfeeding for however many years and doing sleepless nights, I just lost my body, or it became something different.”</p><p>She continued, “Some people lose their boobs. Some people get bigger. Who gives a s–t, right? You just had a child, and your child’s healthy, and that’s all that matters.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Brooklyn-Decker-Candidly-Talks-Getting-in-Shape-After-Pregnancy.jpg><p>On February 7, Decker attended L.A.’s first <a href=#>Fire Drill Friday</a> event, a <a href=#><strong>Jane Fonda</strong></a> and Greenpeace-hosted rally, at City Hall in protest of climate change and action from lawmakers in Washington, D.C. The Battleship actress revealed that she and Roddick are “already having the conversations” with their children about the world’s climate crisis.</p><p>“My kids are&nbsp;2 and 4 and we already talk about it,” she told Us at the event. “We talk about how scarce and precious water is, we talk about taking our own cups to restaurants and to fast food places so that we’re not using single-use plastic. We talk about adjusting ourselves to the planet versus adjusting the planet to ourselves. We’re not perfect, no one’s perfect, but a good friend told me that if I wait until I’m the perfect environmentalist it’ll be too late.”</p><p>Fonda, 82, brought her <a href=#>Fire Drill Fridays</a> to L.A. after hosting several headline-making demonstrations in Washington, D.C. Like Decker, many other high-profile names have participated in the cause, including <a href=#><strong>Joaquin Phoenix</strong></a>, <strong>Martin Sheen</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Rooney Mara</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kate Mara</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There is a collective crisis, requires collective action,” Fonda told <a href=#>CNN’s <strong>Christiane Amanpour</strong> in October 2019</a>. “And so I decided to use my celebrity to try to raise the sense of urgency, and I moved to Washington, and I’m going to get arrested every Friday.”</p><p>With reporting by Kayley Stumpe</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabqp%2BkuK3FzWabnpubmr9ur8Cnm6KcnK56ta3LpKpmn5Wpwaq6xmagp2Wjna6xsYyana2domK9s7HGp5inm6lk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
