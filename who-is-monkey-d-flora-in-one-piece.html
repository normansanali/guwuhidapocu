The fictional story about pirates has completely changed the world of anime and manga as we know it today. Nowadays, it has even become one of the biggest titles in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">card games and merchandise</a>, building the ground for any other anime flourishing in these different realms. Eiichiro Oda’s work has ultimately become the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">driving force of anime in the West</a>, with an unmatched brilliance evident in its writing, storytelling, and, of course, the highly complex world and characters it has built.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=664 data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true>After 26 years in the limelight, One Piece has naturally introduced a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">myriad of characters that some fans can’t even keep up with</a>. After all, everyone knows that Oda constantly brings back characters who haven’t appeared since the very first arc in 1997 – but that’s just a testament to his attention to detail. However, one particular name seems to elude even the most avid fans: the cryptic Monkey D. Flora. If you haven’t heard of this name, worry not – she’s not a vital part of One Piece‘s lore. In fact, she hasn’t even appeared in One Piece. So, here’s all you need to know about this fictional character.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-monkey-d-flora data-injectable=false>Who is Monkey D. Flora?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/One-Piece-Boa-Hancock-Luffy.jpg><p data-characters=618 data-current-count=918 data-injectable=true>Well, first of all, let’s address the elephant in the room: Monkey D. Flora isn’t a canon character. In fact, she was entirely created by fans and exists solely in the realm of fan-made content. Some fans went so far as to craft fan-fiction and blog posts, depicting Flora as the hypothetical child of Luffy and Boa Hancock. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her creators</a>, Flora is depicted as an 8-year-old Kuja warrior in training. Within this fan-created narrative, she is imagined to be born from the relationship between Luffy and Hancock, making her the offspring of two of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most sought-after pirates</a> on the high seas.</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>Naturally, this means that Monkey D. Flora doesn’t actually exist within the official One Piece universe. Instead, she’s a niche creation of One Piece fan lore – her existence holds no canonical influence whatsoever. As you may recall, we’ve already been introduced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to all of Luffy’s family</a> – well, for the most part. His only confirmed biological relatives are Monkey D. Dragon, his father, and Monkey D. Garp, his grandfather.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/the-worst-generation-one-piece.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/luffy-zoro-one-piece.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bege-one-piece.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bonney-one-piece.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/law-one-piece.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blackbeard-one-piece1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/eustass-kid-one-piece-killer.jpg><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>Moreover, we can consider Gol D. Ace and Sabo as his adoptive brothers, and Curly Dadan as his adoptive mother. Beyond these characters, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">no other family ties have been introduced for Luffy</a>. Of course, this doesn’t necessarily mean that potential developments won’t arise in the future, especially considering Hancock’s very one-sided romantic feelings for Luffy. However, any romantic relationship will likely remain inexistent and they might not play a significant role anytime soon, if at all.</p><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=false>Oda has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quite specific in the past </a>about his intention not to delve into romantic relationships in the story and the author even voiced his desire to maintain the story at a Shounen level. Nevertheless, nothing is exactly set in stone, especially as the story reaches its final legs. After all, we’ve already seen an exception to this rule with Sanji and Pudding’s romantically ambiguous relationship. At the moment, though, it’s best to assume that Luffy’s primary focus will remain on his crew, and, of course, his wish to become the Pirate King.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn6hlmah6rrvNpJyyZZRis6270ZpkoqZdpLumec%2BinJydXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
