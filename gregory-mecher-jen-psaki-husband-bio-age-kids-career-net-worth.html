She previously worked as the White House Communications Director during the Obama administration and had also worked in the United States Department of State as a spokesperson.</p><p>The couple met in 2006 while they were both working the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Mecher served as a deputy finance director at the DCCC who regularly traveled in “a very small entourage”. They both had heavy travel schedules, but occasionally found themselves at DCCC headquarters at the same time. Mecher would make a point of regularly trying to walk by Psaki’s desk, which was 20 feet from his own.</p><p>He told the Washington Post that he would regularly walk by Psaki’s desk, which was 20 feet from his own.</p><p>“But when she’s at work, she’s very focused — it’s like tunnel vision. Whenever I would do it, she had the headset on, talking on the phone, the BlackBerry she was typing on and the actual computer in front of her where she was talking to someone else . . . so there was no way to accidentally get her attention.”</p><p>One evening after a shared cab ride and some flirting at 18th Amendment bar on Capitol Hill Mecher made up his mind to ask her out. The last Friday in September, he sent Psaki an e-mail asking her to dinner. She quickly wrote back saying yes.</p><p>The two decided to try long distance dating after Jen got a job offer from the Obama campaign and was asked to move to Chicago in February 2007. In 2009 Mecher proposed to her at home.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gregory-mecher-children></span>Gregory Mecher Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Together with his wife they have two daughters.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gregory-mecher-joe-kennedy></span>Gregory Mecher Joe Kennedy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gregory served as chief of staff for Rep.
