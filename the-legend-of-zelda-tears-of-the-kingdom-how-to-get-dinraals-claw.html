A notable one you may encounter on your travels is Dinraal’s Claw, or you might be asked to find this claw by the Goddess Statue of Power.</p><p data-injection=true>Dinraal’s Claw is a specific item with no true market value and only comes from a single place. The only way to find <strong>Dinraal’s Claw location in Tears of Kingdom</strong> is by tracking down a monstrous creature in Hyrule, and it drops this item after you perform a specific task.</p><h2>Where to Find Dinraal’s Claw in Tears of the Kingdom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/How-to-Find-Dinraal-in-Tears-of-the-Kingdom.jpg><p data-injection=true>You’re likely working on the quest for the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Goddess Statue of Power</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tears of the Kingdom</a>&nbsp;if you’re trying to track down Dinraal’s Claw. This is the second task the&nbsp;<strong>Goddess Statue will ask you complete for its quest</strong>, and it’s a challenging task.</p><p>Dinraal is the giant dragon flying through the sky in the&nbsp;<strong>northeast sky of Hyrule in Tears of the Kingdom</strong>. It’s a dragon flying far off the ground, and you need to obtain one of its claws. The first thing you need to do is figure out a way to get close to it.</p><p data-injection=true>There are several courses of action to take with getting to the Dinraal dragon, such as creating a flying machine using Zonai devices, like the Zonai rocket, balloon, flame emitters, fans, and so much more. These are effective methods to&nbsp;<strong>fly into the sky and chase after Dinraal in Tears of the Kingdom</strong>. We decided to take an alternative route and waited until&nbsp;<strong>Dinraal had flown close to one of the Skyview Towers</strong>&nbsp;and used that Tower to fly into the air and glide towards it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dinraals-Claw-in-Tears-of-the-Kingdom.jpg><p data-injection=true>When you get close to the Dinraal, you’ll want to be careful. It’s a fire dragon, and <strong>its intense heat will begin to damage you</strong>, forcing you to eat food to recover your health or dart away. To <strong>get Dinraal’s claw, take out a bow and fire a single arrow at any of its claws</strong>, and the item will drop. You’ll see a distinct sparkle in the sky where it’s falling, and you can chase after it.</p><p>You can attempt to grab this Dinraal’s Claw in the air or wait until it drops on the ground to grab it. Catching the Dinraal’s Claw in Tears of Kingdom in the air can be difficult because you need to be fast and dive down towards it.</p><p data-injection=true>Although the Dinraal Claw is an item you can fuse to your weapons in Tears of the Kingdom,&nbsp;<strong>we recommend against it</strong>. This is an item you want to save for the Goddess Statue of Power, and offer it to them when you’re working on their quest.</p><p>And that’s it!
