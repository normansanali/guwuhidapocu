Then Tuesday, he got the top prize on the 200X scratch-off game. Both times, he took the lump sum of $6 million each after taxes, according to lottery officials.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Two-time lottery winner Wayne Murray was seen leaving his modest Brooklyn home in a new pricey Range Rover. <span class=credit>Kevin C.

It’s not comprehensible,” H&A store clerk Hassan Nabil told The Post on Thursday.</p><p>Murray is a regular at the convenience store, and “he’s a super regular guy,” the worker said.</p><p>Nabil said Murray hasn’t changed since winning and that he keeps playing the lottery because he seems to enjoy it.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">He took both winnings in a lump sum of $6 million each after taxes. <span class=credit>NY Lottery</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Tuesday’s winnings were from a scratch-off ticket. <span class=credit>NY Lottery</span></figure><p>“He could have moved out of the neighborhood after winning the first time, but he stood his ground,” Nabil said. “Money changes a lot of people, but he doesn’t show off or anything. He keeps it real, keeps it honest.”</p><p>Murray lives in an unassuming three-story, semi-attached brick home where he’s lived most of his life, according to his neighbors.</p><p>And he’s so down to earth that Constance Bryane — whose home is attached to Murray’s — didn’t even know about his incredibly good fortunes.</p><p>“I had no idea. He’s very humble that way,” she told The Post on Thursday. “I’m going to have to congratulate him the next time I see him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmaXBforK1vs5oq6Kbm5rBbsDOZqminJViu7qvjKaYp2WnnbxuttSsq2avn6N6cnzMZqOorKSav7p5wKCYoqZdqL2wwNOem2asn6S5qrrGZpirp6WjsW61zWaZq5memXqvsdZmrqGdlaHAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
