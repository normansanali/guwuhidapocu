I took Jones to the ER because of what I thought was a stomach bug, but it turns out he had some scar tissue built up from his last surgery and needed to have surgery again to fix the problem,” the former Bachelorette, 37, wrote via<a href=#> Instagram</a> on Saturday, August 26.</p><p class=p1>“Thankful for all of the nurses, doctors and surgeons at @levinechildrens for loving on my sweet boy so well,” she continued. “Special thank you to the best pediatrician out there @amoranlanier who I texted and called at all hours to explain to me what was happening in toddler terms because my brain has been mush for the past 18 years, but especially the past couple of weeks.”</p><p class=p1>Maynard added: “My angel Jones is home and hasn’t stopped smiling since. @mtylerjohnson you’re the best dad and I’m so thankful Jones gets to be loved by you.”</p><p class=p1>She also shared several snaps from Jones’ hospital stay in her social media upload.</p><p class=p1>Maynard and Johnson, 36, <a href=#>share five children together</a>: Jennings, 6, Gibson, 5, Gatlin, 4, Magnolia, 2, and Jones, 11 months.

On August 31st, Tyler and I welcomed our sweet son, Jones West Johnson, into the world,” s<a href=#>he wrote via Instagram in November 2022</a>. “During my surgery, we learned that he was born with <a href=#>Down Syndrome</a>, and while it was certainly a surprise, we have so much peace in God’s perfect plan and know Jones is going to be a blessing to our family.”</p><p class=p1>Jones spent more than one month in the NICU before he was able to head home with Maynard and Johnson. Earlier this year, he <a href=#>underwent an ostomy reversal </a>to connect a piece of his bowel to help reestablish the flow of waste through his gastrointestinal tract. Maynard revealed via her Instagram Story in April that the procedure “went great.”</p><p class=p1>After Maynard and Johnson brought their baby boy home from his ostomy reversal, they continued managing life with six kids.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bachelorettes-Emily-Maynard-Says-Son-Jones-Is-Home-From-Hospital-After-Scar-Tissue-Removal-Surgery-02.jpg><p class=p1>“<a href=#>First day of school for 2/6 today</a> and I’m already at home missing them, after a summer of wondering how in the world I was going to survive another. full. day,” Maynard wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> earlier this month. “Ricki starts her SENIOR YEAR tomorrow and it’s a constant reminder every day how quick time goes; when I have to remind myself that even on the longest days ever, these truly are THE days.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “I wish I could freeze time because I couldn’t imagine life getting any better than this. Thoughts and prayers for me tomorrow, as I will be the only mom walking her senior in on her first day of school and hoping my ugly cry doesn’t embarrass her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270Z6rrZ2jYrKutcuyZKaZqaOus7DSZqqopl2fvK%2Bx0mapnpufq7Kztc2gZJ%2Bqn6J6tMHRoJyrsV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
