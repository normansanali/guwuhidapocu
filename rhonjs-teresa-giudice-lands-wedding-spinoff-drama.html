And it wasn’t the first time he’d been accused of <a href=# rel=noopener>acting inappropriately with women</a>.</p><p>“When Louie’s exes came forward, Teresa’s friends were rightfully concerned. But she just laughed off the allegations, and anyone who tries to talk to her about it gets blacklisted,” the source continued.</p><p>And while Teresa’s rep has denied the report, the insider insisted, “Friends are whispering that she should call it off before it’s too late!”</p><p>Following Dina’s exit from the wedding and Teresa’s bridal party, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jennifer Aydin</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Dolores Catania</strong></a> were reportedly <a href=# rel=noopener>added to the event</a> as bridesmaids. As for the rest of the party, Luis’ sisters and Teresa’s daughters, Gia, 21, Gabriella, 17, Milania, 16, and Audriana, 12, will round out the group.</p><p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey <a href=# rel=noopener>season 13</a> is currently in production and expected to air later this year or early next year on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toqpiku6u%2FjK2cq52jlnqotdSdoJydXaGur7DSZq6enJSeu6h50qmgp6eWm3qlvsCmmGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
