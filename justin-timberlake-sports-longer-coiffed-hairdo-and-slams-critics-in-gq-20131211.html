For his special cover and inside photo shoot, the 32-year-old singer styles a new, gravity-defying hairdo.</p><p>Wearing a navy suit, unbuttoned white dress shirt and gray V-neck sweater, Timberlake sports a longer, coiffed hairdo that is buzzed on the sides. The “Suit & Tie” singer also shows off his scruffy beard and chest hair. His new look is similar to 36-year-old “Blurred Lines” singer Thicke’s style, who constantly gets compared to Timberlake for having similar musical styles.</p><p>Perhaps Timberlake’s new ‘do is to match his new attitude. In the <a href=#>magazine</a>, <a href=#><strong>Jessica Biel’</strong></a>s husband slams his critics for hating on his new film, Runner Runner, and album, The 20/20 Experience: 2 of 2, calling it a “double whammy.” GQ reports that Variety ran an op-ed titled “Why Justin Timberlake Should Stop Acting,” after Runner Runner, which also stars <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>, made only $8 million at the box office opening weekend. Timberlake also tells the magazine that Billboard wrote (in his own words), ‘Tell him to leave his second half at home.’ Where did all this vitriol come from? It’s mean. And I’m not cut out for it.”</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async width=467 height=655 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="justin timberlake" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The movie didn’t do well at the box office, so I should quit? Hold on a second,” he says. “If I was somebody else, you wouldn’t have said that. I have the number one album this week, and I shouldn’t have released it? Come on, man. You sound like a dickhead . . . It just shocked me because, like, you’re trade magazines. None of your opinions count. And by the way, none of you can do it.”</p><p>The former ‘N Sync member also tells the magazine that growing up in Memphis, Tenn. defines who he is today — and how he handles criticism. “It’s a struggling city with a defeatist attitude. I’m from this town, and I grew up with a little bit of a chip on my shoulder, so sometimes I find it funny that I’ve been able to acquire the patience it takes to be kind to people in our business,” he says. “Because sometimes I just want to f–king kill everybody.”</p><p>For more of Timberlake’s interview, pick up the December issue of GQ.
