He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> as much on April 22, 2021. The tweet was accompanied by a snap of the cover page of the script to the special.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>"This is the wrapping. The present is inside. #GotGHS," said Gunn. Star Wars star Mark Hamill, however, does not feel&nbsp;good about this idea, perhaps because he is afraid&nbsp;history will repeat itself.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Hamill Has A Bad Feeling About This</h2><p>Just hours after Gunn made his tweet, Hamil <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reposted</a> the tweet saying, "I have a bad feeling about this." To which Gunn came back with, "These things ALWAYS go well." Both Gunn and Hamill are well aware that these things don't "ALWAYS" go well.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>These things ALWAYS go well. — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">April 23, 2021</a></p><p>This is most certainly not the first time that a franchise has attempted a holiday special, and this will not be the last. Much like Marvel, the Star Wars franchise tried their hands at a holiday special back in '78. The Star Wars Holiday Special&nbsp;made it on-air once on Friday, November 17, 1978, on CBS and never again. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Much like you expected from this buildup, the show did not go well. In fact, it is regarded as one of the monumental failures of the franchise. So much so, series creator George Lucas once <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p><p>If I had the time and a sledgehammer, I would track down every copy of [The Star Wars Holiday Special] and smash it.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>And guess what? Mark Hamill was the face of this gargantuan mess. According to him, the show was initially designed to&nbsp;“help keep&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;in the [public] consciousness.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">according</a> to the folks over at Esquire, the show was, and I quote, "an unfortunate mix of unwise ideas and creative chaos." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The failure is usually credited to a lack of hands-on interest and supervision from Star Wars creator Lucas who, at the time, was engrossed with The Empire Strikes Back.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Holiday Special Fits into the Existing MCU</h2><p>Getting back to the shenanigans of Starlord and his ragtag crew, The Guardians Of The Galaxy Holiday Special is set to take <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">place</a> within the existing continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>To be more precise, this special will be taking place after the events of Thor: Love and Thunder and before Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.&nbsp;</p><p>The special will probably also give fans a better insight into how Peter Quill and Thor's friendly rivalry in the last two Avengers movies evolved, given that the fourth iteration of Thor is set to heavily feature the Guardians as well.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The holiday special does not come with a release date yet, but the Thor sequel will be released (hopefully in theatres) on May 6, 2022, while the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will be available sometime in 2023.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Kus7eMoZimoZyhequtzJ6qZp%2Blo7tus9SaqZ2hkaPAbrvFZquhnV2crq2t17JkoaecnrGixYysp56bmZa5b7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
