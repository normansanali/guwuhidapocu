But who would have thought that&nbsp; “<b>As Tears Go By</b>” was a Rolling Stones original and a piece co-penned by Sir <strong>Mick Jagger</strong>? Well, indeed, it’s true! In 1995, Mick Jagger recalled the creation of this song. He stated,</p><p style=text-align:center><span style=color:#930>“I wrote the lyrics, and Keith wrote the melody. It’s a very melancholy song for a 21-year-old to write: The evening of the day, watching children play – it’s very dumb and naive, but it’s got a very sad sort of thing about it, almost like an older person might write.”</span></p><p>He then continued and said,</p><p style=text-align:center><span style=color:#930>“You know, it’s like a metaphor for being old: You’re watching children playing and realizing you’re not a child. It’s a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time. And we didn’t think of doing it, because the Rolling Stones were a butch Blues group.&nbsp;</span><span style=color:#930>But Marianne Faithfull’s version was already a big, proven hit song… It was one of the first things I ever wrote.”</span></p><h2><strong>About the Song</strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify>A song written by Rolling Stones members <strong>Mick Jagger</strong> and <strong>Keith Richards</strong>, and manager <strong>Andrew Loog Oldham</strong>, “<b>As Tears Go By</b>” was originally recorded by&nbsp;<strong>Marianne Faithfull</strong>. She released it as a&nbsp;single&nbsp;in 1964.&nbsp;“<b>As Tears Go By</b>” reached no. 9 in the&nbsp;United Kingdom.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Later, the Rolling Stones recorded their own version and released the track in late 1965. It was included on their album&nbsp;<i>December’s Children (And Everybody’s)</i>&nbsp;and subsequently as a single in&nbsp;North America.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In 1966, it proved it’s a hit as it reached no. 1&nbsp; on Canada’s RPM Top Singles. Also, it peaked at no. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><h2><strong>The Song’s Genesis</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countrythangdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/old-site-uploads/2018/05/michaelputland-1024x679.jpg><p style=text-align:justify>“<strong>As Tears Go By</strong>” was one of the first original compositions by Jagger and Richards. The story has it that Rolling Stones manager&nbsp;<strong>Andrew Loog Oldham </strong>locked Jagger and Richards in a kitchen to force them to write a song together. Moreover, Oldham even told them what kind of song he wanted and how would they do it.</p><p style=text-align:center><span style=font-size:20px;color:#930>“I want a song with brick walls all around it, high windows and no sex.”</span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Initially, the result was entitled As Time Goes By.&nbsp;It was the title of the song that Dooley Wilson sings in the movie Casablanca. Consequently, Oldham replaced Time with Tears in the title of the song.</p><p>After writing and composing the song, Jagger and Richards performed the piece to Oldham. Richards stated,</p><p style=text-align:center><span style=color:#930>“We thought, what a terrible piece of tripe. We came out and played it to Andrew [Oldham], and he said ‘It’s a hit.’ We actually sold this stuff, and it actually made money. Mick and I were thinking, this is money for old rope!”</span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Watch Marianne Faithful perform “<strong>As Tears Go By</strong>” in 1964.
