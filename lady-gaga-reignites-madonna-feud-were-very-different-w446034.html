The “Joanne” singer insinuated that the Queen of Pop doesn’t write her own music or play instruments.</span></p><p>It all started after host Zane Lowe compared Gaga to Madonna and brought up their relationships with their dads.</p><p>“There is another artist who has lived a very parallel existence,” Lowe told Gaga, whose new album drops on Friday, October 21. “Based on this story, which I’m sure you can relate to. You know Madonna tells a very similar story … overprotective father … ‘Papa Don’t Preach.’ You know what I mean.”</p><p>Gaga, actually, didn’t agree — like, at all.</p><p>“Madonna and I are very different,” the “Perfect Illusion” singer, 30, quipped. “Just saying. We’re very different. I wouldn’t make that comparison at all and I don’t mean to disrespect Madonna, she’s a nice lady, and she’s had a fantastic huge career, biggest pop star of all time. But I play a lot of instruments. I write all my own music. I spend hours and hours a day in the studio. I’m a producer. I’m a writer. What I do is different.”</p><p>By “different,” Gaga explained that she’s “not just rehearsing over and over again to put on a show.”</p><p>“There is spontaneity to my work,” Gaga said. “I allow myself to fail. I allow myself to break. I’m not afraid of my flaws.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The<i> American Horror Story </i>actress reiterated to the radio host that she feels there are “major differences” between herself and Madge, 58.</p><p>“I don’t mean that in a disrespectful way,” she concluded. “I just will not be compared to anyone anymore I am who the f–k I am and this is me. My life story is my life story, just like yours is. The thing is we all express things in different ways, but my rebellion at my father for him being angry with me, that has ended. It’s like finally I can bite back.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>The singers have previously been pitted against each other. Madonna accused Gaga of “blatantly ripp[ing] off” her song “Express Yourself” when she released “Born This Way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmZSueqitxppkq52ZnLuqwMSsZKaZlKS7r62Mn5yunF2ssrOxjK%2Bcq7FdmbanssSrnKesXayBdYKPbGto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
