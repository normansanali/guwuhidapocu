Ian had a close relationship with his parents, particularly with his father, who instilled a strong value system.</p><p>Schrager said about his childhood home:</p><p><strong>“When I was growing up I always had modest surroundings, but they were nice, stylish …[My parents] had a gold couch, black furniture, white walls, my parents had good taste.”</strong></p><p>Ian later added:</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-72949 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ian-schrager-net-worth.jpg.webp alt="ian schrager net worth" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ian-schrager-net-worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-72949 class=wp-caption-text>Ian Schrager, owner of the Paramount Hotel in New York City, 5th October 1990 – @Getty</p><p><strong>”It wasn’t fancy, it wasn’t worldly, but it was good taste.”</strong></p><p>His mother, Blanche, died when he was 23. His father, Louis (who died when Ian was 19), owned a factory in Long Branch, New Jersey, that manufactured women’s coats.</p><p>In 1968, Schrager graduated from Syracuse University and majored in economics. In 1971, he earned a JD from St. John’s University School of Law.</p><p>There he also met Steve Rubell, who would become his lifelong friend and business partner.</p><p>During an interview, Schrager explained:</p><p><strong>“We were dating the same girl, and from the way we went about competing for her, we came to respect and like each other.”</strong></p><p>Schrager continued:</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-72953 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ian-schrager-family.jpg.webp alt="ian schrager family" width=750 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ian-schrager-family.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-72953 class=wp-caption-text>Jade Jagger, Ian Schrager and Kate Moss at a party celebrating the launch of his new hotel – 1999 – @Getty</p><p><strong>”And the friendship just got closer and closer and closer.
