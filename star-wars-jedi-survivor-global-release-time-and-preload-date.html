The only people who will be able to play <strong>Jedi Survivor</strong> “early” are those who received a review copy of the game or were fortunate enough to secure a copy of the title from a retailer that broke the street date.</p><p>These release times only apply to digital copies of the game. Anyone who pre-ordered a physical copy will either have to wait for it to arrive in the mail or for a retailer to open on the 28th. Even though <strong>Jedi: Survivor</strong> releases digitally on the evening of the 27th, gamers on the West Coast probably can’t walk into a Target at 9 pm and hope stores shelves are stocked with physical discs. However, no matter what version you buy, you will have to sit through a huge install, so to start playing as soon as you can, you might want to forgo the physical disc (heresy, I know) and pre-order the digital version.</p><p>While many gamers anticipated <strong>Jedi: Survivor</strong>, the game recently acquired the wrong type of attention thanks to the news it would <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eat up 155 GB of space</a>. Comparatively, <strong>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</strong> is 1/3 of that size at only 55GB. Not only do <strong>Jedi: Survivor</strong>’s Sarlacc-sized files necessitate an SSD, thus precluding Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions, but depending on your internet speed, a Sarlacc might actually be able to digest you before the game is finished installing. This is where pre-loading comes in. EA opened up the pre-install floodgates on April 25, and now everyone who pre-ordered the game can download it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><p>That’s about everything you need to know about <strong>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong>’s release. We’ll have much more to say about the game once more of you have actually had the chance to play it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOrKuaql2srrO%2FjKOcnaFdqMKzwsivpqtll6G8o63LZqmepJWWwKZ506KknmWRo7FuvNGeo6iZlGKxosDEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
