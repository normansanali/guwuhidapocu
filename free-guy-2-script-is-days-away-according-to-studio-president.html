We were thrilled that Free Guy was as successful as it was, and particularly as an original movie at a time where few get made and even fewer are hits.</p><p>So that was gratifying. And if we can crack that sequel, that’s something that might be very fun to make together.”</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>It is refreshing, however, to know that Levy and Reynolds aren’t just rushing out some cash grab, theoretically anyway.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>“We had such a clear idea of the tone, the story, the details of&nbsp;Free Guy, and we both made a few sequels in our lives, and so we know how hard it is to make a worthy one.
