The resulting series has seen a gradual rise in interest as trailers arrive and hook viewers on the unmatched chemistry between leads Donald Glover and Maya Erskine.</p><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=883 data-injectable=true>The original film is a childhood favorite of mine, but it’s got little in common with Prime Video’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reimagined take on the story</a>. Sure, both releases follow married spies as they work to traverse the hurdles of their unique profession, but in 2024’s Mr. & Mrs. Smith our spies are entirely aware of one another’s backgrounds. In an intriguing flip on the original premise, the titular Jane and John are fully aware of one another’s backgrounds, and their marriage instead comes about as cover for a range of missions.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>The series deviates, to some degree, from the action-packed stylings of its predecessor, but that’s not to say that plenty of explosions, gunfire, and violence aren’t in store for viewers. The original sported a middle-of-the-road PG-13 rating, but shows often have more freedom to lean into gore and violence. Will that be the case for Prime’s Mr. & Mrs. Smith, or is the fresh series appropriate for kids?</p><h2 id=h-prime-video-s-mr-mrs-smith-parents-guide data-injectable=false>Prime Video’s Mr. & Mrs. Smith parents guide</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>Any release sporting the reasonable amount of bloodshed and violence depicted in Mr. & Mrs. Smith‘s trailers is likely unsuitable for young children, but once they start to reach their early teens things loosen up.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Mr. & Mrs. Smith doesn’t have an official rating just yet, but it will likely land around that same middle-of-the-road PG-13 rating. It sports some bloodshed, general violence, light drinking, and occasional swearing, all of which disqualify it from being considered a family-friendly show, but none of which should prevent even younger teens from enjoying it.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parentguiding.com</a> advises parental discretion for younger viewers, and lists its more “mature” themes as including “moderate to intense” action scenes, “mild” romantic scenes,&nbsp;but no explicit nudity or sexual content, occasional language, occasional alcohol consumption, and occasionally intense or suspenseful moments.</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>It’s up to parents to decide what their individual kids can handle, and what level of action and suspense is appropriate. For anyone under 13 or so, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mr. & Mrs. Smith</a> is likely a bit mature, but anyone else will find heaps to enjoy in the delightful series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4ymqWaloqh6tLnIrZ9mmaClv7C80aKYrZ1dm7yzecqim6xlpJ2ybr%2FHqK6sZaCWv6a606xkoK2ZmbJusdepo5qhnpqxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
