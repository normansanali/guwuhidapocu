Because to the disappearance of their son Jacob Fahlfeder, we are in urgent need of your assistance. Kayla, his sister, is continuously adding additional information to the post that is pinned at the very top of my Facebook page, so I would appreciate it if you could please check it out.</p><p>The last time anyone saw him was when he left their home in Ruckersville, Virginia, on Tuesday evening about 7:00 p.m. to go to the grocery store. This was the very last time anyone saw him.&nbsp; He left the house without going back inside. It is thought that he is driving a white Toyota Venza, and he has not shown up for work (he works in NOVA). Pinging his phone is something the cops are attempting to do right now.</p><p>This time around, I have included a photograph of a vehicle that could be regarded as being analogous to the one that he is driving. My brother Brandon, in addition to his mother Tori, has lost all semblance of sanity. We are reaching out to my friends in Northern Virginia, as well as those in Roanoke or the Richmond region, or even those who live toward the seaside or in Lynchburg, and I am requesting that they please get in touch with me if they have any information and that they also kindly forward this information along to others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwtsCcpptllpa1rbLEnZyrZZ2ewLS1zaBkqZ2iqLyvecWapKKkqWK8sbHNrGSsnZGnsKl5xaipZqKRmLyjecWan6WelZmys3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
