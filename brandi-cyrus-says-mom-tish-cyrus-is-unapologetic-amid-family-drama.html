News</a>&nbsp;at the 2024 CMT Music Awards on Sunday, April 7. “And I love that for her. She has been so supportive of all of us. She’s really the backbone of this family.”</p><p>Noting that people may only know Tish, 56, for her famous family and working with Noah, 24, and <strong>Miley Cyrus</strong>, Brandi added: “For her to be in the limelight a little bit and for people to see the star that is Tish Cyrus makes me happy.”</p><p>Without directly addressing Tish’s recent drama with Noah regarding her relationship with husband <strong>Dominic Purcell</strong>, Brandi added, “At the end of the day, your family’s what you have and your family is what matters, and those relationships are more important than anything to us.”</p><p>In February, a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that Noah “was [seeing] Dominic when Tish started pursuing him,” claiming that Tish “was aware” of her daughter and the 54-year-old actor’s connection. “The turmoil between Noah and Tish goes far beyond [what people think],” the insider added. “Noah is very distraught over Tish stealing Dominic from her.”</p><p>Tish and Purcel were first romantically connected in 2022 following Tish’s divorce from ex-husband <strong>Billy Ray Cyrus</strong>. (Tish and Billy Ray, 62, share daughters Brandi, Noah and Miley, 31, <a href=#>as well as sons</a> Trace, 35, and Braison, 29. Billy Ray also shares son Christopher, 32, with ex <strong>Kristin Luckey</strong>.)</p><p>Tish was also married to <strong>Baxter Neal Helson</strong> from 1986 to 1989, while Purcell wed <strong>Rebecca Williamson</strong> in 1998 before parting ways 10 years later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Brandi-Cyrus-Praises-UnapologeticMother-Tish-Cyrus-for-Being-Backbone-of-the-Family-Amid-Drama.jpg><p>“Things couldn’t be going better for Tish and Dominic,” another source told <a href=#>Us</a> in February 2023 after the couple took their romance public. “She truly feels like she found her soulmate.” The pair got <a href=#>engaged</a> the following April and <a href=#>tied the knot</a> that August.</p><p>Not all of Tish’s children were in attendance at the wedding as Noah and Braison <a href=#>skipped out</a> on the Malibu nuptials. “Tish will always love her kids no matter what,” an insider told Us in August 2023. “She understands divorce might be challenging especially when she and Billy Ray had been together for so long.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following her recent drama with Noah, Tish <a href=#>remains hopeful</a> that they will be able to make amends in the future. Noah, however, “is not open to any reconciliation,” a revealed to <a href=#>Us</a> last month, adding that Noah “refuses to communicate” with Miley.</p><p>After Tish admitted on a March episode of Brandi’s “Sorry We’re Stoned” <a href=# rel=noopener>podcast</a> that there were <a href=#>“definitely issues”</a> in her and Purcell’s marriage, an insider told <a href=#>Us</a> earlier this month that “they’re working on communication and sought therapy together.”</p><p>A second insider added: “[The scandal] pushed them away from one another [and it’s] going to take time to heal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpGjsap5wrKprqtdqK66v4ympqZlpJ7AqXnCsqmuq12ewG7BzZqnqKSfnLK1tcJmmKahlGKzornIpbBmnKKWuqJ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
