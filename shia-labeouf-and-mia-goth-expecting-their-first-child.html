A reconciliation appeared to have taken place, though, by the time the Peanut Butter Falcon actor was spotted wearing a wedding ring in April 2020, with Goth likewise caught on camera wearing both a diamond ring and a wedding band. More recently, the couple were seen arm-in-arm on a day out at Disneyland in June 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1c0b1a24-b331-4aca-883d-f81463e88eb7-getty-1185815950.jpg><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>The English-born Goth was most recently featured in 2020 Jane Austen adaptation Emma and 2021 action drama Mayday.
