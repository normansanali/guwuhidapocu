He was being considered for the role but it went to the unnamed actor instead.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Cosmopolitan, Daniel Franzese</a> – who played Cady's friend Damien in Mean Girls – revealed this:</p><p>“I met Lindsay [at the cast meeting dinner], and Lacey Chabert too. I hit it off with everyone and I remember leaving, saying, 'I’ll see you all tomorrow at the table read. I’m the only one who doesn’t have the part yet,'” Franzese said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Jonathan Bennett wasn’t cast yet either.

People kept coming over to him like, 'You know, you should really take your hat off.' And then, right after the table read, he got fired and they called Jonathan Bennett, who I guess was their second choice.”</p><p>He didn't reveal who the actor was though.</p><p>“I don’t want to embarrass him, I’m afraid. He has worked consistently, he’s a good guy.”</p><p>Franzese emphasized though that it was not James Franco. Apparently, Lohan had shared with him that Franco was once considered for the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Lindsay recently told me that, even before [the actor who got fired], James Franco was considered for the role of Aaron Samuels,” Franzese said. “I thought that was so cool.

This is exactly the part I want to play.’ So we did a read-through, and we were trying to look for somebody to play the role of Cady, but frankly, we didn’t find anyone... who felt strong enough to go up against Lindsay.”</p><p>Lohan became really popular because of Freaky Friday around that time, and so he was advised to make her the lead instead of the villain.</p><p>And though one would think that Rachel McAdams was an obvious choice for Regina once Lohan got cast as Cady, that wasn't really the case. Amanda Seyfried was also on the consideration list. But McAdams beat her out, according to Waters, because the former was "more intimidating."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>McAdams was really dedicated to playing Regina and prepared for her role extensively</a> before filming.
