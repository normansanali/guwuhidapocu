Kelly is of Irish-Italian and American nationality.</p><p>Kelly has been interested in dancing since she was five years old, when she began learning River Dance, a traditional Irish dance. &nbsp;She would go on to practice dancing for the next 10 years, and perform all around New Jersey and New York, which made her somewhat popular in high school. After she matriculated, Kelly enrolled at Rutgers University from which she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in meteorology – during her time there, Kelly was a member of the Rutgers Meteorologist Club.</p><p>As Kelly wanted to further work on her education, she enrolled at the Middlesex County College and became an Associate of Science in Mathematics.</p><h2><span id=Career_of_a_meteorologist>Career of a meteorologist</span></h2><p>Kelly launched her career soon after she obtained her bachelor’s degree in meteorology, as she started working for WWOR-TV network as their intern in 2011. The network decided not to keep her after she finished her internship, and Kelly moved to Cheyenne in Wyoming and began working for the CBS News network.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fvcwql1grmm31-1-576x1024.jpg></p><p>Kelly did not stay long with CBS News as she switched to WSAZ-TV in 2013, where she became somewhat recognized as a meteorologist. She was part of the WSAZ-TV team for a year, working as their weather broadcaster before she moved to Boston and began working for the <a rel=nofollow href=#>WCVB station</a> – she can be seen reporting every day in the “Storm Team 5” show. Kelly’s career and her skills at broadcasting have won her an award – the Best Weather Broadcaster Award in 2013 for her coverage of the Colorado floods.</p><h2><span id=Love_life_and_husband>Love life and husband</span></h2><p>Kelly is the kind of a woman who prefers to keep her personal matters to herself, but as both she and her husband are somewhat popular, some things regarding their marriage are still known. Kelly met Edward Davila while they were both attending Rutgers University – Edward is a sales representative who is currently working for the Pioneer West Virginia Federal Credit Union. They were an instant match and launched their relationship not long after meeting, but dated for several years before exchanging their wedding vows on 11 October 2015.</p><p>As they were both very attached to their university and loved it because it gave them an opportunity to meet, they decided to marry in the chapel of Rutgers University. It appears as both Kelly and Edward have been completely focused on their careers throughout the years, which is perhaps why they don’t have any kids, and it doesn’t appear as they are planning on starting a family anytime soon.</p><p>Being as secretive as she is, Kelly hasn’t shared details regarding any other man she might have dated before Edward, and judging by her social media accounts and her own statements, this is Kelly’s first marriage and she doesn’t have any kids.</p><h2><span id=Hobbies_and_other_interests>Hobbies and other interests</span></h2><p>Kelly is mostly focused on her career of a meteorologist, but there are still numerous other things she enjoys doing in her free time.</p><p>Kelly is a fighter for human rights, and actively helps the community and people in need – she is an active volunteer for the Habitat for Humanity and could have been seen during the Ellie Runway held in 2017 as she was helping gather money for breast cancer patients. Even though Kelly has no children, she enjoys working with them and can often be seen going to elementary and high schools where she teaches children about weather, and helps them conduct experiments.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>☀️?☀️Ending the weekend on a good note as the sun is already starting to break through. Patchy fog will dissipate, as temperatures reach towards 80°F this afternoon. Cooling down from here… Happy SUNday!!! <a rel=nofollow href=#>#wcvb</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/WdUJDVsJap</a></p><p>— Kelly Ann Cicalese (@kellyannwx) <a rel=nofollow href=#>September 15, 2019</a></p><p>Kelly is also quite focused on both her physical and mental health. She has several training sessions at the gym each week – she first started going to the gym to get rid of piled-up stress, but eventually fell in love with working-out, taking extra care of her weight and maintaining a strict diet. She is an avid tennis player, and often plays with her colleagues from work – speaking about her mental health, Kelly does yoga and meditates on a daily basis.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_net_worth>Appearance and net worth</span></h2><p>Although Kelly hasn’t confirmed her year of birth with the public, she is around 32 years old. She has long blonde hair and blue eyes, is 5ft 8ins (1.73m) tall, and weighs around 143lbs (65kgs).</p><p>According to authoritative sources, Kelly’s current net worth is estimated to be more than $700,000, and is steadily rising thanks to her career of a weather broadcaster.</p><h2><span id=Social_media_presence>Social media presence</span></h2><p>Kelly is more or less active on the internet – ‘more’ because she is very active on Twitter and Facebook and ‘less’ because she doesn’t seem to have an Instagram account. Kelly uses her Twitter account to discuss random things with her fans, while the main purpose of her account is to inform people of the weather conditions – she launched her <a rel=nofollow href=#>Twitter account</a> in January 2013, and has since gathered more than 8,000 followers and tweeted nearly 6,300 times. She is also very active on her Facebook page, which currently counts almost 17,700 fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCpnZSerm%2B70aBmpJ2cocZurc2nZJyhk5a5pr%2FEZq6io5lir6q7jJqenmWYmraotNNmn66rkpa7pXnSmqOaqqlir7Cw2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
