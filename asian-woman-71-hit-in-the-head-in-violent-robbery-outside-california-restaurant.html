He managed to take Perez’s purse, which contained money, her ID and credit cards, according to reports.</span></p><p><span>Perez was rushed to the emergency room, where she was reportedly found to have bleeding in the brain. Her <span>latest CT scan</span> reportedly showed that the bleeding has stabilized.</span></p><p><span>While Perez’s condition is improving, family members remain distraught – prior to the incident, the Filipino American family and their friends visited San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge and bonded over dinner.</span></p><p><span>“These are cowards. They prey on elderly. My stepmom is 71 years old,” Dennis told NBC Bay Area. “She’s just having a nice night out with friends and family, and for this to happen, it’s sickening.”</span></p><p><span>This recent attack adds to the surge in violent robberies targeting elderly Asian Americans across the U.S. Dennis is demanding solutions.</span></p><p><span>“You always hear about it, but when it becomes personal, you know, something really needs to be done about this. I mean, it’s ridiculous,” Dennis told KTVU.</span></p><p><span>Vallejo police are investigating the incident. Perez remained under observation as of Monday night.</span></p><p><span>Featured Image via </span><span><span>NBC Bay Area</span></span></p><h3>Support our Journalism with a Contribution</h3><p>Many people might not know this, but despite our large and loyal following which we are immensely grateful for, NextShark is still a small bootstrapped startup that runs on no outside funding or loans.</p><p>Everything you see today is built on the backs of warriors who have sacrificed opportunities to help give Asians all over the world a bigger voice.</p><p>However, we still face many trials and tribulations in our industry, from figuring out the most sustainable business model for independent media companies to facing the current COVID-19 pandemic decimating advertising revenues across the board.</p><p>We hope you consider making a contribution so we can continue to provide you with quality content that informs, educates and inspires the Asian community.<br><span class=donate_way><strong>Even a $1 contribution goes a long way.</strong></span> Thank you for everyone’s support.
