Her birth name is Donatella Francesca Versace. Her father’s name is&nbsp;Antonio Versace and her mother’s name is&nbsp;Francesca Versace.</p><p>She has three siblings namely,&nbsp;Gianni Versace, Santo Versace, and Tina Versace. Donatella holds Italian citizenship and Italian ethnicity. Her birth sign is&nbsp;Taurus.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Education_School_College_University></span>Education, School/ College University<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Talking about Donatella’s education history,&nbsp; Donatella Versace&nbsp;enrolled at Florence University in Italy to pursue languages. She was very close to her brother Gianni who encouraged her passion for fashion.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Donatella_Versace_Professional_Life_Career></span>Donatella Versace:&nbsp;Professional Life, Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Talking about her profession, during 1979, Donatella moved to Milan to work with Gianni, first as a design assistant and later in the public relations department.</p><p>She was the only person who could contradict her brother with her constructive criticism. She also plunged into the fashion world during the 1980s.</p><p>Gianni launched a perfume ‘Blonde’, dedicated to her and gave her own diffusion label, ‘Versus’, which remains a well-known Versace inner line.</p><p>The assassination of Gianni in Florida in July 1997 devastated her, but she quickly recollected herself and took over as the chief designer. In October, she made her solo debut for spring the following year.</p><p>In the year 1998, Donatella Versace mounted her first couture show for the Versace Atelier at H0tel Ritz Paris. She built her runway over the hotel’s swimming pool, like her brother, but this time using sheer glass.</p><p>Whereas, her first collection, attended by a host of celebrities, was a triumph. But in typical Donatella fashion, she credited its success to the seamstresses and models and dedicated the show to her late brother.</p><p>The show became an annual event, with regular guests including Catherine Zeta-Jones, <a href=#>Elizabeth Hurley</a>, Elton John, and even <a href=#>Prince Charles</a>. Additionally, she began to use well-known models for the catwalk shows, to generate press coverage.</p><p>In addition, several low-key receptions, however, did not deter her. She continued to manage earlier collections, but she believed that she could not just continue with what Gianni was doing.</p><p>The company created the grand, luxurious Palazzo Versace resort on the Gold Coast of Australia while the Burj al-Arab, in Dubai boasts a broad collection of Versace furniture and beddings in its lavish rooms.</p><p>In fact, the plans for the Palazzo Versace Dubai were announced in May 2005. The Palazzo Versace boasts a number of suites and luxury villas, including an exclusive spa. As Creative Director, Donatella executed the final plans.</p><p>In 2008, she was made the honorary chairman for London’s ‘Fashion Fringe’. The ‘Fashion Fringe’ was an initiative by fashion writer Colin McDowell and ‘IMG Fashion’ to support emerging designers.</p><p>In the year 2009, Donatella asked Christopher Kane, the Scottish designer, to revive ‘Versus’. The pair successfully revitalized the brand, making it a major player again on the ‘Fashion Week’ schedule.</p><p>In November 2012, Kane departed from ‘Versus’ as the Italian fashion house planned to completely overhaul the label, ceasing the production of seasonal collections – with a renewed focus on digital.</p><p>Similarly, JW Anderson, an Irish designer was appointed to create a capsule collection for the ‘Versus’ label, as he’s well versed with the new digital world and therefore, an ideal partner for their new direction. She started using pop star Lady Gaga as her muse, and in October 2012, in a much-publicized visit, invited the pop singer to her late brother’s apartment in Milan.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Awards_Nomination></span>Awards, Nomination<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Regarding awards and nominations, Donatella Versace has won the Favorite Fashion Designer at MTV Asia Awards.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_much_is_the_net_worth_of_Donatella_Versace></span>How much is the net worth of Donatella Versace?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She has an estimated <strong>net worth</strong> of around $1 billion (as per 2022 data) and she has earned that sum of money from her professional career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Donatella_Versace_Rumors_Controversy_Scandal></span>Donatella Versace: Rumors, Controversy/ Scandal<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Up to now, Donatella Versace has maintained a good relationship with all other people in her personal and professional life.
