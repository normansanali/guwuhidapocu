Dr Pepper and her team have matched couples together who got married sight unseen. For some couples, MAFS has seen them end up with the fairytale romance they always dreamed of, but for many, it’s ended in disaster.</strong></p><p>MAFS season 14 couple Chris and Alyssa already opted out of the programme and got divorced leaving just four couples remaining on the Lifetime show. As the weeks roll on, fans of the show are putting in their predictions on which couples will stay married after the show. So, let’s take a look at what viewers are saying about MAFS season 14 and who they think will still be together at the end of the series.</p>BridTV9751Ready to Love | Trailer | discovery+https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mO7CPE73l00/hqdefault.jpg10020261002026center22403<figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mafs-season-14-steve-and-noi>MAFS season 14: Steve and Noi</h2><p>Married At First Sight couple Steve and Noi started out as one of the more promising looking couples on season 14.</p><p>However, as the social experiment has gone on, Steve and Noi don’t appear to be as loved up as they once were.</p><p>Many MAFS fans have taken to Twitter to comment on Steve and Noi’s relationship with many confused on Noi’s uncertainty about living together but also wanting three children.</p><p>One viewer suggested in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> they don’t think Noi and Steve will go the distance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Noi and Steve really not gone live together after decision day!?!?!<a href=#>#MarriedAtFirstSight</a> <a href=#>#mafs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tKBI1T7Ayx</a></p>— Thesarcasticoptimus (@TheSO7_) <a href=#>April 28, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=fans-give-their-take-on-mark-and-lindsay>Fans give their take on Mark and Lindsay</h2><p>Mark and Lindsay have had a pretty tumultuous journey on MAFS in 2022.</p><p>Judging by Twitter, it looks like viewers have mixed feelings when it comes to Mark and Lindsay’s future together.</p><p>Some MAFS viewers have high hopes for Mark and Lindsay.
