One of Caster’s absolute favorite things to do is to make MJF as uncomfortable as possible on social media. Caster does so by thirsting after MJF after every single tweet he puts out and it appears that Caster did it once again.</p><p>MJF is the current AEW World Champion and he makes sure fans know just how good he is, whether it be inside the ring or on the microphone. That said, quite a few fans have started to like MJF’s egotistical nature.</p><p>In case you didn’t know, Max Caster constantly makes thirsty comments on anything posted by MJF on social media.&nbsp;Obviously, The Salt Of The Earth is never pleased with such behavior and even told Caster to follow a&nbsp;<a href=#>restraining order he apparently had against Caster</a>.</p><p>MJF recently started a <a href=#>partnership with Kaylin + Kaylin pickles</a> and promoted his new venture on social media. Unsurprisingly, Max Caster took to Twitter and once again thirsted over MJF.</p><p>I’ll grab your pickle any time, pal 😏😉😛💦🥒</p><p>Max Caster <a href=#>previously thirsted after MJF as well</a> and that’s unlikely to change anytime soon.&nbsp;Regardless, we’ll have to see what AEW has planned for The Acclaimed on television in the coming weeks.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your take on Max Caster’s thirsty behavior? Do you think he should stop?
