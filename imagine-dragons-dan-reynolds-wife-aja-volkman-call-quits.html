"After 7 beautiful years together, Aja and I's marriage has come to an end," he <a href=#>tweeted</a>. "Our children continue to be the most important thing in our lives, & we will continue to co-parent them with all our love."</p><p>Reynolds <a href=#>added</a>, "I ask that you please respect our privacy at this time as we work through this as a family."</p><p>As noted by <a href=#>E! News</a>, Reynolds and Volkman married in March 2011. Together, the two have three children, daughters Arrow Eve, Gia, and Coco.</p><p>Volkman <a href=#>released a statement</a> on her own Instagram page regarding her breakup with Reynolds. In a text post, she wrote, "I've been hesitant to release any sort of statement about our marriage. All that I can say is that I am so grateful for all the abundance I have experienced in my life with Dan." She continued, "I am grateful that long ago we met in a casino when our dreams were big and full of optimism. Life doesn't always go as planned, but to live is a blessing. And as they always say, it's better to have loved and lost then [sic] to never have loved at all."</p><p>Prior to her statement, Volkman had <a href=#>shared a quote</a> by Tyler Kent White, which read, "She woke up every morning with the option of being anyone she wished. How beautiful it was that she always chose herself."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlpboNze8immKChnpp6pb7AoKanq12Zrq950Z6wp6ecmcBuw8ifnGaZmpZ6t7vLpKSapl2Yrq24jKqsoqyjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
