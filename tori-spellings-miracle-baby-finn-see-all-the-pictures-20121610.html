"I just remember thinking, I can't leave three children behind." Spelling and husband <strong>Dean McDermott</strong>, 45, were already parents to Liam, 5, Stella, 4, and Hattie, 12 months.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Spelling endured four months of strict bed rest in the hospital — a period in which she missed Liam's preschool graduation as well as Stella's fourth birthday party — but she stayed "strong," she told <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>"I kept envisioning myself holding a healthy baby. That was my goal," the Beverly Hills, 90210 alum explained.</p><p>Making it to an impressive 37 weeks, Spelling and McDermott were beyond overjoyed when Finn arrived at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in L.A. "When they put him in my arms I was like, 'We made it. We did." Now we have an insane bond. We've been through hell and back."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatp6KeerS8xKWjoqaXqHqutdGamqWdXZeuo8WMn6Cnpl2osqZ5wKWjZqyYmnqxtcKtrKudo2J%2FcX2Ram1qaF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
