She posted a photo of her balloons and baby bump to Instagram on Sept. 25 and wrote, “By far the BEST birthday 👶🏽.” But many fans decided to mock her birthday “present”! Well, that’s because the owner of AmourJayda Hair announced her pregnancy after her boyfriend <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lil Baby</strong></a>, who’s collaborated with big names like <strong>Drake</strong> and <strong>Offset</strong>, reportedly admitted in April that he cheated on her with his baby mama, <strong>Ayesha</strong>. The 23-year-old rapper indirectly addressed Ayesha on his Instagram Story, screen grabs from which&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>VladTV</a>&nbsp;posted on April 17. “You won’t someone to kno I fucced you, well yes I did!! But you trippin none more none less!! Ain’t no way you go try ruin my relationship!! We happy dawg!!” He then added,&nbsp;“You my baby mama of course I done f***ed you!!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Afterwards, Ayesha blasted Lil Baby’s girlfriend on her Instagram Story, writing, “Let’s not ignore the fact that Jayda wanted proof of her man cheating then once I gave her receipts of her man cheating she justifies it then her man went public in front of 1.1million followers to admit that he’s cheating.” And Jayda has claimed during an Instagram Live session that she spotted “a b*tch” on Lil Baby’s balcony, also claiming they’re neighbors. However, the mystery woman wasn’t identified, and Jayda herself has not confirmed that Lil Baby cheated. But fans are still taking shots at the entrepreneur after today’s pregnancy news!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Amour Jayda’s lil knucklehead self really got pregnant by Lil Baby….. after he cheated on her with his baby momma and a rando. That’s wild,” one fan <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a> on Sept. 25. Another fan called out the confusing baby mama triangle, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeting</a>, “Amour jayda really went & got pregnant by lil baby after all that drama she go through with his baby mama & he don’t do nothing about it wheewww chileeeee.” And a third fan just couldn’t take it anymore. “Sooo this Amour Jayda and Lil Baby, Baby Mama beef/drama/fiasco is mentally draining and embarrassing af on BOTH parties behalf,” she wrote. We’re mentally drained, too.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Well, the past is past. We’re just thrilled to see a young woman hustling as a CEO&nbsp;and&nbsp;has an exciting blessing coming her way!
