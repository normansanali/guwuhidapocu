Earlier this year, she released <a href=#>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</a> — a re-recording of her 2008 album. Coming up next is a new rendition of her 2012 pop album Red which housed the singles, "We Are Never Getting Back Together" and "Begin Again."</p><p>The 31-year-old singer surprised fans, joining the popular social media network TikTok. On August 23, Swfift posted a video rocking some of her infamous past looks.

She ends the video with straightened long hair, blunt bangs, and a black turtleneck, shouting out the fashion style she favored when first recording Red.</p><p>In response, many fans light-heartedly teased the singer for her basic outfits and heavily filtered look, saying that she looks more like a "doppelganger" than the actual Taylor Swift. One fan wrote, " "Y'all it's real, I really thought it was deep fake or her look alike. Taylor Swift really joined TikTok."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another said, "Taylor hired a doppelganger to make TikToks for her."</p><p>A third fan chimed in, tweeting, "This is so weird. Why does this not look like her?? It looks like these people who think they look like Taylor so they dress up like her all the time goodbye."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s Why Taylor Swift Doesn’t Speak To Lorde Anymore</a></span></p><p>While Swift's self-cosplaying may need some more work, she never fails to draw the attention of her fans.

It was all over the place, a fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end. Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild, and tortured by memories past."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Songs Taylor Swift Has Written About Her Boyfriend Joe Alwyn</a></span></p><p>She added, "this will be the first time you hear all 30 songs that were meant to go on Red.
