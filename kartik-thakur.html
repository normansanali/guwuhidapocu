His birth date, March 21, 1994, was disclosed by media outlets after his demise. Kartik was a child when he first learned about the Indian Army and Air Force. When he was in school, he wanted to be an aviator.&nbsp;Kartik excelled in school, which aided him in obtaining accreditation as an Air Force pilot.</p><p>Kartik attended Bhartiya Vidhyarthi School Baijnath and then the Army School of Sujanpur Tihra for his basic schooling. He then pursued B. Tech. He had always wanted to soar in the sky like an animal, so he chose the IAF, whereas Kartik, who had won the M. Sc computer from DU, turned down a position worth millions of pounds for the sake of the country’s service. Kartik, 23, joined the Indian Air Force three years ago after passing the Combined Defense Services (CDS) test. He was in training these days. He was stationed in Hyderabad and last visited his family in Lahla six months ago.</p><h2>Kartik Thakur Height & Weight</h2><p><b>Kartik Thakur is 6 feet 0 inches tall</b><span>.

Kartik served in the Army for three years, so his pay would most likely range between 1-1.5 lakh Rupees. And, in the event of his demise, he would have left his family with a net worth of roughly 2 lakhs Rupees.</p><h2>Career (Updated on September 2023)</h2><p>Kartik Thakur, who entered the Indian Air Force to do great things for his nation, perished at a young age, limiting his future. His accomplishments as an IAF commander were legendary. He did not participate in any Indian Air Force secret operations. For three years, he worked as an officer in the Air Force. If he were still living, we are confident he would have achieved the same success as Abhinandan Varthaman, an Indian jet pilot.</p><p>People in India will never forget Abhinandan Varthaman’s courageous tale, and if Kartik were living today, he would undoubtedly have written an encouraging narrative for future Air Force officers. Despite the fact that he perished four years ago, he is still honored by Indian Air Force fans. Every new Indian Air Force pilot gave homage to him because he was a patriot who toiled for his country’s betterment.</p><h2>Kartik Thakur Girlfriend & Dating</h2><p><b>Who is Kartik Thakur’s dating?</b><span> Kartik Thakur perished when he was only 24 years old.
