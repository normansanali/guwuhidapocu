Either way, finding the perfect dress the bridal party will feel comfortable in all day that complements the bride's dress as well as the wedding theme, can be difficult. However, we are here to help. &nbsp;</p><p id=ezhmTBRFw6ii data-wc=56>Pink has without a doubt been the colour of 2023 thanks to the Barbie movie, and as a result we're expecting to see even more pink bridesmaid dresses. Dusty pink, blush pink, baby pink and hot pink are all great shade options for bridesmaid dresses - and there's something to suit all skin and hair colours.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>How to style a pink bridesmaid dress</h2><p id=exorcjiYUG data-wc=79>Thankfully, most shades of pink are super versatile, making it easy to style a pink bridesmaid dress. If the bridal party are wearing heels for the big day, white is a common option, or if you want to go bold, why not try a lilac or an orange to inject some added colour into the wedding photos. If flat shoes are on the cards, a pair of pearl white ballet flats would look lovely with a pink bridesmaid dress.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><h2 dir=ltr><strong>How we chose the best pink bridesmaid dresses</strong></h2><ul><li dir=ltr><strong>Variety:</strong> We've chosen bridesmaid dresses in a range of designs, from slinky styles to classic pieces, in blush pink, hot pink, baby pink and dusty pink shades.</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Inclusivity:&nbsp;</strong>We've tried to select a variety of styles that would suit a range of ages and body shapes, so there should be something for everyone.&nbsp;</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Price:&nbsp;</strong>We've chosen pink bridesmaid dresses with a range of price points, from affordable high-street styles to luxury pieces.&nbsp;</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Trusted brands:</strong> All the brands I've chosen are trusted brands I, or members of the <strong>HELLO! </strong>team, swear by.
