Later that month, the pair <a href=#>vacationed in Mexico</a> with the former supermodel, 55, and businessman, 58.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cindy-Crawford-Adores-Kaia-Gerber-Boyfriend-Jacob-Elordi.jpg><p>After photos showed them cuddling up poolside during the trip, an insider told Us that her family thinks “he is a stand-up guy and a breath of fresh air.”</p><p>The couple <a href=#>became Instagram official in October</a> when they shared photos of themselves dressed as Elvis and Priscilla Presley for Halloween. “Kaia had sent me the idea, as there was a specific photo of Priscilla and Elvis that they wanted to recreate,” Gerber’s makeup artist Sam Visser told <a href=#>Vogue</a> of the look. “I love Kaia. She’s always open to trying new things and isn’t afraid to go outside of her comfort zone.”</p><p>Though Elordi is primarily known for his roles in The Kissing Booth and Euphoria, he’s also done a bit of modeling, which gives him plenty to talk about with the former Vogue cover girl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cindy-Crawford-Adores-Kaia-Gerber-Boyfriend-Jacob-Elordi-2.jpg><p>“It’s actually crazy how much they have in common,” the first source continues. “It was like the universe brought them together! They’re both models, modeled for Calvin Klein — very into fashion, of course. They love going shopping together and even working out together. They’re truly some of the kindest people you will meet.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gerber was previously linked to <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a>, whom she dated for three months before they split in January 2020. Elordi dated his Kissing Booth costar <a href=#><strong>Joey King</strong></a> from 2017 to 2018, then later had a brief fling with his Euphoria costar <a href=#><strong>Zendaya</strong></a>. Neither party publicly addressed the relationship before they went their separate ways.</p><p>When fans started commenting on the actor’s relationship with Gerber, he asked them to remember he is “human being” before sending him messages about his love life. “Try a little kindness, pay it forward and I promise it will find it’s [sic] way back to you,” he wrote on his Instagram Stories in September.</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoZ6Zxm6v0Zqun6eimXqzrc2dnGaflaevpr6MmpuoqpViuKK1wKxkm55dn66ku8FmnKWnopm2cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
