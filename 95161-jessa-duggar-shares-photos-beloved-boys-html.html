She took to <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlVdLhSFISV/?utm_source=ig_embed"><i class=Vg>Instagram</i></a> to share adorable photos of her little boys on July 17, 2018.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Popular amongst them was an image and video of Spurgeon seated on a small tractor trying to move the handles as his mom asked, “Is that fun to do?” To learn more, follow us on <i class=Vg>Twitter</i> <i class=Vg><a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/amomama_usa>@amomama_usa</a></i>.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Jessa further asked him if he wanted to mow once he was bigger to which her son replied in the affirmative.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>According to Jessa, she was not aware of any child of Spurgeon’s age who loved mowers, tractors and skid steers as much as he does.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>‘I’ve never know [sic] another little boy who’s more in love with mowers, tractors and skid steers. It makes his day if he gets to sit in the seat and ‘drive’ it.’</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:right>Jessa Seewald, <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlVdLhSFISV/?utm_source=ig_embed"><i class=Vg>Instagram</i></a>, July 17, 2018.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Another picture depicted Spurgeon looking into the distance. The reality star said that his ‘beautiful blue eyes’ were just like his father’s.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>A third image was that of Henry lying on a bed. His hands were behind his head as he took a short nap. Jessa wrote that her child asleep with his ‘chubsy’ toddler hands behind his head was the cutest thing she had ever seen.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Jessa also took time out to respond to a person on Instagram who told her that Spurgeon should no longer be wearing diapers at his age.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Jessa said that she believed children were not ready to be out of diapers until they were able to complete the entire task – pulling their pants down, going to the toilet, putting their pants on, and washing their hands – on their own.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>She added that otherwise, it felt like it was the parent doing all the dirty work. She said her elder son was getting close as there were signs of his readiness, but there was still some time.</p>Read also<a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>I Saw a Birthmark on Baby Niece’s Body and Realized That My Husband’s a Cheater – Story of the Day</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Girl Takes Ring Off Granny’s Hand at Her Funeral, Wakes up at Night and Sees Silhouette in Her Room – Story of the Day</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Boy Blows Candles on B-Day Cake and Suddenly Falls to the Floor Unconscious – Story of the Day</h2></a><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>In 2014, Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald got married in the First Baptist Church in Bentonville, Arkansas.
