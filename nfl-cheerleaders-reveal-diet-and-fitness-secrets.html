Fashion</strong> caught up with Atlanta Falcons' cheerleaders Jasmine and Kat to find out how they stay in shape… <strong>Scroll below for their diet and fitness secrets</strong></p><p><figure></figure><strong>Jasmine is a cheerleader for the Atlanta Falcons</strong></p><strong>What are your top tips for getting the most out of a workout? </strong><strong>Jasmine:</strong><p id=eOObCXhU5sr3 data-wc=28>Set realistic goals and don't over exert yourself – develop a workout that works for you, because what works for your friends may not fit your personal goals.</p><strong>Kat:</strong><p id=ez1cZ9idHMMh data-wc=38>I use my workout as an escape from everyday life – forget about your to-do list and just be in the moment. Stay hydrated, and focus on your goals. Use them as constant motivation to do your best.</p><strong>What's a typical training session like for your routines? </strong><strong>Jasmine:</strong><p id=euWAyghkYyPU data-wc=33>Stretching, of course, and then working on a specific area I've designated for that day. One day might be on my core, another on my lower body, and then on my upper body.</p><strong>Kat:</strong><p id=ezB5IN3r9szj data-wc=30>All of our dance routines are extremely physical so I have to stay on top of my game. An average workout will consist of some jogging, stretching, and core strengthening.</p><p><figure></figure><strong>NFL cheerleader Jasmine revealed she tries to exercise every day</strong></p><strong>What exercises do you like to do to stay in shape? </strong><strong>Jasmine:</strong><p id=ehH8cFvmPiHk data-wc=28>Anything that involves dancing! I enjoy finding exercises that will fit whatever target area I would like to work on. Crazy enough, I love doing squats and crunches!</p><strong>Kat:</strong><p id=er1kplsAZCiL data-wc=28>My favourite activity is running – I'm also a Track and Field athlete so I do a lot of sprint work mixed with core strengthening and some lifting.</p><strong>How many times a week do you workout? </strong><strong>Jasmine:</strong><p id=ez9EMzfuqcw9 data-wc=51>At least 4 days a week, more if my schedule allows. I try to do something each day, even if it's something small. My schedule doesn't change before a performance, I keep it consistent – I like to look at my exercising as a platform to build stamina for my performances.</p><strong>Kat:</strong><p id=eUaqC-r-aGX4 data-wc=20>I typically workout 5 days a week with Thursdays and Sundays being my days off, unless we have a game.</p><p><figure></figure><strong>Kat performing one of the Atlanta Falcons cheerleaders' routines</strong></p><strong>Do you watch what you eat before a big performance? </strong><strong>Jasmine:</strong><p id=eY2xV4s2q_bg data-wc=36>I watch what I eat at all times, I don't necessarily focus my eating around a performance. This way I've developed a lasting lifestyle, so I don't have to be too conscious of my meal choices.</p><strong>Kat:</strong><p id=e_26SRqd8TL5 data-wc=47>I absolutely watch what I eat before a big performance. Eating habits affect how you look, but more importantly how you feel and how you perform. It is definitely a balancing act to make sure you are getting enough of the right nutrients to sustain your energy.</p><p><figure></figure><strong>Left: Kat, Right: Jasmine</strong></p><strong>What are your top healthy eating tips?</strong><strong>Jasmine:</strong><p id=efd0mGTLkzWQ data-wc=49>I absolutely love fruits and vegetables – as a kid I never had trouble eating leafy foods. I also try and drink the recommended ounces of water daily. I make it a game with my co-workers, it's somewhat of a buddy system to ensure we are all on track.</p><strong>Kat:</strong><p id=eQu-lph32vtq data-wc=63>I won't lie, my eating habits are not always what they should be. When they're at their best, I try and make sure to eat breakfast and try to eat multiple smaller meals throughout the day, incorporating lots of protein and vegetables. I stay away from fast food. I've never tried a juice cleanse, eating clean is the way to go for me.</p><strong>What's the best fitness advice you've ever received?</strong><strong>Jasmine:</strong><p id=eVjdlOc55NFS data-wc=21>Stretch, stretch, and stretch some more! Also, be happy. It's easier to maintain your fitness if you're doing something you enjoy.</p><strong>Kat:</strong><p id=ece-X2ed1yXd data-wc=24>The best advice I've ever received is not to skip meals. Being 'hangry' is never fun and only causes you to over eat later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGlpaWRmfXODlGxocG9fo7OtecKhnJ6qnJqupbHRrGSrnaaarq15w6KcrWWRo7FussitpZ6ro2LApq%2FRnqusZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
