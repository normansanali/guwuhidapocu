But when Hitler threatened to attack New York and sent U-boats capable of carrying long-range rockets uncomfortably close to the East Coast, the U.S. military had to take him seriously.</p><p>Thus was born Operation Teardrop, the U.S. Navy’s campaign to hunt down German boats in the North Atlantic.
