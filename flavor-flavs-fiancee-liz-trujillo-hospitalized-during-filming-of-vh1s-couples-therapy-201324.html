They have so much of it, in fact, that they're working through their issues on VH1's Couples Therapy. But on Monday, April 1, things took a scary turn when Trujillo — the mother of one of the Public Enemy rapper's seven children — had to be hospitalized while they were filming the reality series.</p><p>It's unclear, though, what led to the hospitalization. <a href=#>TMZ</a> initially reported that the 39-year-old overdosed on painkillers, a scenario that was confirmed by <a href=#>E! News</a>. A VH1 rep told the site that the alleged overdose was accidental and that Trujillo was fine and had been taken to the hospital just as a precaution.</p><p>However, a spokesperson for Flavor Flav later denied this version of events and gave a different account to TMZ. "The claim of an overdose, or any involvement of drugs, could not be further from the truth," the rep said. Instead, Trujillo was treated for exhaustion after being kept awake all night for filming.</p><p>Couples Therapy is just the latest VH1 reality series for Flavor Flav. He previously appeared on The Surreal Life, where he developed a relationship with actress <strong>Brigitte Nielsen</strong>, and then on Strange Love, a spin-off about the couple's relationship. When Nielsen left him to go back to her fiance, he got his own show, Flavor of Love, about his search for romance.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Trujillo wasn't a contestant on the series, but she somehow ended up with a proposal on the reunion show anyway. The couple have been engaged since 2008.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGafpJGrvLN5xaWYr6tdm7aiusKenGakma96tb7Uo6ClpJ9itbC%2Fz6KrmqSZr7KlecOuqaKml2KzqrjMoqWgZZ%2Bbere0kKxknKelpbmmv4ytn56qkaXGbn6PamprbF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
