But as you research the different ways to color your hair, your excitement wains. Highlights, lowlights, partial highlights, babylights, balayage, ombré, the list goes on. If you've settled on highlights but aren't sure what's best for you, fear not. A <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>good hairstylist</a> should use their expertise to help you understand the difference in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>highlight shade or technique</a>. We turned to three celebrity colorists to learn how to make this decision. Here’s everything you need to know about partial highlights, including benefits, how to choose, and how they differ from full highlights.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Meet the Expert</p><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Jafra Bryant</a> is a celebrity and editorial colorist.

Bryant usually goes with the most classic method of highlighting using foils. "This is a more popular technique because it's a foolproof, speedy way to guarantee a lift or lightening effect," Bryant says, adding that the process of foiling is pretty simple: "Isolate the pieces or section, put in foil, add bleach enough to cover so it saturates through the hair. <span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"></span>Feather up or down for a seamless blend that can be manipulated later with gloss." Sometimes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>colorists will use heat</a> or not and the results can range from soft and natural to super bright blonde, depending on the developer and stylist you're working with. "Using foil also allows me to use multiple shades in the highlighting service, which creates a soft blend between the client's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>natural color</a> and the blonde lights," adds Walker.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Highlights are strategically placed pieces of color that are lighter than the natural hair color. They can be done using a set pattern with foils or be freehand painted highlights such as <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>balayage</a>—each process and technique are vastly different in their approach but can reach a similar end goal depending on what the hair needs.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That being said, Bryant adds that all the techniques have sub-categories and everyone works differently to achieve a common highlight goal. "There's no wrong or right, just art."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-partial-highlights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Partial Highlights?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Partial highlights, like balayage, are a more freehand way of highlighting that can be gentler because it's painting "open-air." It's usually indicated for those who want warmer highlights, but not only. "Balayage can be just as bright as foils these days, especially with the new <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>anti-breakage</a> and ashy toners we have now," says Bryant. The colorist believes it can be gentler due to the different levels of saturation and different types of heat conductors that can be paired with balayage techniques for higher lift—rather than using a foil as a heat source.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@hollyrhue</a> / Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Partial highlights are only in sections, usually placed around the face to give off a brighter, face-framing look. Some stylists consider a partial highlight to be the entire top ​half or the top and side sections of your head. "You can also ask your colorist to include the hair underneath, so when you put your hair up it looks like more," says Bryant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Partial highlights are ideal for those seeking a more natural look, as they're designed to lighten the hair the same way the sun would. "It's great for a quick brighten-up or root touch-up if you part your hair the same way every day," says Walker. It's also a good option for an introduction to adding some color to your hair.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-full-highlights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Full Highlights?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A full highlight involves highlighting hair in every section of your head. This could be slightly lightening all of your hair or for something more dramatic, going from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>brunette</a> to blonde. They offer a more dramatic look, as they wrap all around the head (think a perfectly painted balayage, multidimensional full-foil highlights, or a mix of partial and full highlights). "The main benefit is having everything done and knowing no matter how you wear your hair, the color will look great," Bryant says.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=12.96><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@matildadjerf </a>/ Instagram</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-partial-highlights-vs-full-highlights-vs-babylights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Partial Highlights vs. Full Highlights vs. Babylights</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the budget-conscious, alternating between full and partial highlight appointments can be more cost-effective, as the highlights placed in the back of the head don't have the same growth as the highlights on the top of the head. "I've learned to balance them both when needed," says Bryant, who reveals a favorite regimen is doing a full once or twice a year and getting away with mostly partials and the occasional face frame depending on the look. "This way the client can save some time and money while keeping their color fabulous and not stuck in a rut."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>babylights</a>, this technique adds subtle dimension to the hair. "Babylights are great if&nbsp; your client is wanting light blonde highlights that are woven very fine and close together for a more natural look that you&nbsp;would achieve from the sun," says Rivera.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-benefits-of-partial-highlights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Benefits of Partial Highlights</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Less expensive: </strong>partial highlights are typically cheaper than a full highlight service. "Most partials will be about $100 less than fulls on average," says Bryant.</li><li><strong>Less damage:</strong> As you're only highlighting a few sections, you'll likely experience less hair damage.</li><li><strong>It looks more natural:</strong> Because you'll still see your base color, partial highlights look more soft and natural.</li><li><strong>Low maintenance: </strong>When compared with full highlights, partial highlights' new growth is less visible.&nbsp;"The time you can get before needing a full highlight can stretch beyond four to five months of needing a full. It depends on someone's natural color, where they get highlights to, and the brightness," Bryant adds.&nbsp;</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-benefits-of-full-highlights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>&nbsp;The Benefits of Full Highlights</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Big change: </strong>For those who want to go from dark to light, full highlights are a great option.</li><li><strong>Great for fine hair: </strong>The hair will look more textured and dimensional with full highlights.</li><li><strong>Endless options:</strong> You can go as subtle as blonde highlights or as dramatic as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>colorful highlights</a>.</li><li><strong>Versatile: </strong>According to Bryant, the color will look great regardless of half up, half down, braids, or swapping textures from curly to straight.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-do-partial-highlights-work-for-all-hair-colors></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Do Partial Highlights Work For All Hair Colors?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes and no. Bryant explains that when it comes to different levels and depths of hair color, anyone can get a partial highlight. "The only reason I'd say no is simply because a lot of people think if they just did a partial it would look like everything is done or would be more cost-effective," he says. The expert alerts that only doing partials can look disconnected, with the underside of the hair making no cohesion to the top color, for example.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No matter the style of highlight you choose, using the right products are key in maintaining a fresh color. "It’s imperative to use a professional color shampoo and conditioner. This will hydrate and strengthen the hair and also help maintain longevity of your color," says Rivera.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Byrdie Tip</p><p>Take a few inspiration photos to your stylist to ensure you get the outcome you're after—and ask the expert which technique is best for it. Make sure to find inspiration from people who have the same skin tone and eye color to fully envision what you want your new hair to look like.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-choose-between-partial-and-full-highlights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Choose Between Partial and Full Highlights</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Walker, partials are great for those who don't want to see a lot of regrowth, don't have a lot of time, and want to keep their hair in good health. This is great for someone with lower maintenance highlights such as warmer shades and who don't mind a bit of root every so often. "Really blonde clients alternate between the two, and go with full highlights every second appointment," says Walker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When the back of the head starts to look way too dark on a ponytail, then it's time for a full highlight. "They'll want color all the way around for a cohesive look and grow out depending on what they want their color to look like," Bryant explains. Full highlights are more of a high-maintenance color, keeping to fulls is perfectly fine to keep your hair color looking updated at all times.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Both experts agree that spacing out your highlights and interchanging can help keep hair integrity giving different sections time to breathe and heal before going in again, especially for the ones with long hair. "My general rule is after three times of a partial, it's probably time for a full—unless you want to continue the depth underneath," says Bryant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If the gap of the root look is not large and/or the top still covers the dark from the back part of your head, you're probably okay for a partial. Make sure to ask your colorist what to book for next time knowing a full highlight may be needed after a few times of partials.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-final-takeaway></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Final Takeaway</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most people have no idea what to book an appointment for, so it is mostly up to the colorist to help educate them on the type of upkeep needed to maintain the look they want.&nbsp;"Finding the right colorist that understands this about foiling, free-handing, and adjusts to work with it is key," says Bryant. And keep in mind: Final highlighting decisions don't have to be made when scheduling your appointment. When in doubt, a good stylist will be open to full consultation with room to make adjustments on the day of your appointment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8XRnaCeZpOkunDDx5qrrGWknbJusMifnZ6qlaOwpnnBnquwnZWjeqJ5z5qpraGRoXqptcaho6KfmKl6orrDZphmnqWhuW60yKCfpaGXncFuf5Rqbm9sYg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
