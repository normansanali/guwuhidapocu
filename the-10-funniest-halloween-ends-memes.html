This has emerged in the form of a new killer, Corey Cunningham (Joseph Quin). His transmogrification from a murder-accused babysitter and a bullied high school student into a cold-blooded murderer in the movie has received mixed reviews from critics and fans. While some were glad to see this slight deviation from what seems to be an eternal dual between Myers and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Laurie Strode </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">(Jamie Lee Curtis)</a>, others expressed resentment towards Myers making a cameo appearance in his own movie towards the end.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Between the excitement and thrill of witnessing the fate of Michael Myers and the dissatisfaction over the lousy killing of a larger-than-life iconic villain, social media is replete with some of the funniest memes about almost every ill-fated plotline. Let‚Äôs have a look at 10 of the best Halloween Ends memes amidst the gruesome killings.</p><h2 id=h-the-final-entry-of-the-iconic-slasher-film-was-boring data-injectable=false><strong>The final entry of the iconic slasher film was boring</strong></h2><p dir=ltr lang=en>Me during Halloween ends <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8s6aWkqnSH</a></p>‚Äî Trent The Guy (@trent_memes) <a href=#>October 14, 2022</a><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>Not everyone was happy with the turning point of the story transforming Corey into The Shape. There were many complaints about his collaboration with Myers, and basically the 40 minutes devoted to a high school teen romance that didn‚Äôt imply any ominous presence of a killer. Yes, the plot reeks of boredom and bears the power to push one into a deep siesta.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Dissatisfaction with the franchise‚Äôs end</strong></h2><p dir=ltr lang=en>The perfect Halloween Ends meme doesn‚Äôt ex‚Ä¶. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bYQIFyX0cl</a></p>‚Äî HorrorWench (@CC_1069) <a href=#>October 15, 2022</a><p data-characters=121 data-current-count=121 data-injectable=false>The ending of the franchise‚Äôs final movie was a letdown for many fans.
