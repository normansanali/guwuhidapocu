"Ginnifer and Josh seemed very relaxed and happy," an insider told the publication. "They were surrounded by their nearest and dearest friends and kept it very intimate and simple. "The magazine added that guests started arriving from 5:30pm at the Los Angeles wedding, to the sound of a Spanish guitar playing in a romantic courtyard. The attendees were treated to a cocktail reception, before going in for the ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4016610c663e-ginnifer1-z.jpg><p id=eXsWwh0JBHwX data-wc=29>Ginnifer and Josh, who <a class=hm-link href=#>got engaged in October&nbsp;</a>of last year, are a notoriously private couple and have not made mention of their nuptials on their social media accounts.</p><p id=eYMC-cq5CGz data-wc=119>The small-screen actors first started dating in 2011 after meeting on set in Canada, but went public with their romance in March 2012."Because they were both away from home, they inevitably started to socialize together off the set as well as on," an insider said at the time. "The relationship has been full-on since the moment it turned romantic. There was no reason to wait and take it slow â€” they fell in love, and it feels right. "Ginnifer has also made no secret of her desire to start a family. The new bride, who is conscious of her age, has previously said that she wanted to "have a lot of kids before [she's] physically unable to do so."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfl7%2BqsMSsZmtoYWl9dX2Sam9qbmNktKq6zaKdnqpdnLywsNaipWain6i1brDApaOaq12osqS%2BxK1ksJ2Umbavs44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
